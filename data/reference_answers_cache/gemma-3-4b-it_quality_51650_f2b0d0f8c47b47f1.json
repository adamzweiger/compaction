He stammers, feels embarrassed, and mentions forgetting his chips. He also expresses a desire to \"get the hell out of here.\" These all point to a feeling of awkwardness and a desire to escape a situation he\u2019s not comfortable in.\n\nOption A (He was thirsty) is irrelevant; the text doesn't mention thirst.\nOption B (He was no good at playing craps) is a minor detail that doesn\u2019t explain his overall reaction.\nOption C (He was embarrassed) directly aligns with his behavior \u2013 stammering, forgetting his chips, and wanting to leave quickly.\nOption D (He was not religious) is unlikely, as he expresses a desire to leave a religious establishment.\n\nD"

He feels guilty because he knows it\u2019s essentially exploiting a lost civilization for profit.\n\nConsidering this, the most accurate answer is:\n\nD"

The old mother planet and so on.\u201d The passage focuses on his Martian origins as a key factor in her attraction.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A. He was exotic:** This aligns perfectly with the text\u2019s direct statement.\n*   **B. He was a college professor:** While this is true, it\u2019s presented as a secondary detail and not the primary reason for her interest.\n*   **C.

The higher gravity hurt his feet:** He mentions his legs are longer due to Martian evolution, and his feet ache from the gravity. This is a genuine physical struggle.\n*   **B. His outdated clothes embarrassed him:** He notes his clothes are forty years out of date, attracting unwanted glances.\n*   **C. The officials yelling at him upset him:** He\u2019s clearly disconcerted by the aggressive behavior of the passport official.\n*   **D. The thicker air was hard to breathe:** He describes the air as \u201clike a ton of wool\u201d and notes his ears are \u201cshuddering\u201d from the noise.\n\nWhile all these are challenges, the description of the air is the most vivid and impactful. The sensation of the dense, heavy atmosphere \u2013 \u201clike a ton of wool\u201d \u2013 is presented as a genuinely unsettling and difficult experience for Matheny.

Life was bleak enough on the deserts, without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend who was happily trying to mark the cards.\" This clearly indicates that gambling was prohibited on Mars.

She then cleverly manipulates the situation by claiming a headache and reducing the amount she\u2019s willing to pay to five hundred thousand credits.\n3.  Throughout the conversation, Doran repeatedly tries to persuade Peri to secure Matheny a Martian \u201cgo-between,\u201d using the appeal of a wealthy, clueless Martian heir.\n4.  The text explicitly states that Doran convinces Peri to arrange a meeting between Matheny and a \u201cslipstring\u201d (a con man), leveraging her position and influence.\n\nConsidering these points, Peri subtly but effectively used her influence and negotiation skills to get Matheny to agree to pay for the con man\u2019s services.\n\nD"

It\u2019s described as \u201cpoor,\u201d reliant on Earth for supplies and money, and struggling to compete with Earth\u2019s corporations. The author highlights the high costs of shipping goods and the exploitation of Martian resources by middlemen.\n2. **Technological Level:** While Mars has achieved some technological feats (pneumo transport, automated services), it\u2019s presented as lagging behind Earth in areas like manufacturing and distribution. The reference to the \u201cBillingsworth Expedition\u201d and the fabricated Martian ruins underscores a deliberate effort to create a fabricated history to attract investment.\n3. **Social Structure:** The society is portrayed as being dominated by powerful Earth-based entities (like the Grant, Harding & Adams Public Relations Agency) and reliant on exploiting Martian resources and artifacts.\n4. **Political Situation:** The Martian government seems weak, with limited ability to regulate trade or protect its own interests. They are desperate for outside investment.\n\nConsidering all of these points, Mars is clearly behind the times compared to Earth.\n\nD"

This takes a significant amount of time, as described by his reactions (difficulty breathing, disorientation).\n4.  **Meeting Doran:** Matheny meets Doran at the bar and they begin discussing the possibility of hiring a con man.\n5.  **Planning and Information Gathering:** The story then details Matheny and Doran discussing the Martian economy, past schemes, and potential contacts.\n6. **Concluding Conversation**: The story ends with Matheny considering the possibilities for a Martian bucket shop and Doran promising to find a suitable con man.\n\nConsidering the detailed descriptions of Matheny\u2019s reactions to Earth\u2019s environment and the lengthy conversations about Martian business practices, it's clear that a considerable amount of time has passed \u2013 more than a day or even a week.
