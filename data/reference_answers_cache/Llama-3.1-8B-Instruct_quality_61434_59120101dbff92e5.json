Therefore, the least warlike Qornt would be one that is currently a Verpp, as they are less aggressive than Qornt.\n\nSo, the correct option would be the one that is closest to being a Verpp, which would be a passive Verpp."

Nitworth, the Ambassador, is trying to come up with a plan to deal with the situation.\n3. The options for the plan are:\n   - A. Flee the planet to be safe.\n   - B.

Retief has to confront the Qornt due to a punishment he receives.\n\nConsidering the situation, the most likely course of action would be to try to negotiate or find a peaceful resolution, but since that's not an option listed, we can consider the remaining choices.\n\nOption A, fleeing the planet, is a defensive strategy, but it doesn't address the root issue of the Qornt's aggression. Option C, sending Magnan on a recon mission, is a good way to gather information, but it doesn't directly address the Qornt's threat. Option D, Retief confronting the Qornt due to a punishment, doesn't seem to be a planned course of action.\n\nOption B, standing and fighting against the Qornt, is the most proactive and direct approach, which seems to be what Nitworth is considering.

The question mentions that the Qornt are at the harbor, planning an invasion, but it does not mention them attacking the expedition.\n\nThe Zubb and the other Verpp are friendly, but it is mentioned that there are other, more aggressive aliens, like the Gwil and the Boog, who are mentioned as being involved in the invasion. However, when the expedition is attacked, it is not by these aliens, but by a different group.\n\nThe text does not specify the exact group that attacks the expedition, but it does mention that Magnan is grabbed by two eight-foot bipedal creatures with green-clad legs and a beaked face, which are described as looking like Qornt, but are actually Verpp. However, when Retief and Magnan are walking to Tarroon, they come across the Qornt, who are described as being \"sturdily built rascals, all over ten feet in height\" and \"bloodthirsty, aggressive, merciless countenances\".
