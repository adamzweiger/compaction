However, Kelly quickly dismisses him and attempts to frame him. Dan\u2019s willingness to risk everything to simply *observe* the theft, staying in the vault all night, demonstrates a desire for information rather than immediate gain.\n\nThen, he encounters Blote, who offers him a lucrative deal to acquire the carrier. Dan doesn\u2019t hesitate to accept, effectively abandoning Kelly\u2019s offer. This shift reveals he wasn't genuinely interested in either man\u2019s plans but solely focused on obtaining and utilizing the time machine. The ending, with Dan fleeing with the carrier and encountering Dzhackoon, confirms this selfish motivation.\n\nD."

The narrative emphasizes Dan\u2019s panicked attempts to avoid detection and the looming threat of being caught. The scene is filled with a sense of urgency and danger, highlighting Dan's precarious situation. The feeling of being watched and potentially exposed is palpable.\n\nOption A \u2013 A feeling of suspense because the girl could notice Dan at any moment \u2013 accurately captures this heightened sense of anxiety and danger.\n\nOption B \u2013 A feeling of success because the encounter proves that Dan successfully time-travelled \u2013 is incorrect because the encounter is fraught with peril and doesn\u2019t represent a triumph.\n\nOption C \u2013 A feeling of horror knowing that Dan could be arrested from his previous escape \u2013 While there\u2019s a hint of that, the primary feeling is more about immediate danger and escape.\n\nOption D \u2013 A feeling of unhappiness because Dan\u2019s mission to time-travel had failed \u2013 This isn\u2019t the dominant feeling; Dan is still actively pursuing his goal, albeit in a compromised situation.\n\n**A**"

He explains the carrier\u2019s function, provides information about the Inter-dimensional Monitor Service, and essentially teaches Dan how to use the device.\n\n2. **Without Blote:** If Dan hadn\u2019t encountered Blote, he wouldn't have gained this crucial knowledge. He would have been completely in the dark about the carrier\u2019s capabilities and how to control it.\n\n3. **Abandoning Blote:** Because he wouldn\u2019t have understood the carrier\u2019s workings, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to escape Blote.\n\n4. **Seeking Help:** He wouldn't have had a source of information to turn to.\n\n5. **Capture:** The narrative states that he had to run from the police.\n\nConsidering these points, the most accurate answer is:\n\nD"

This suggests that \u201cInter-dimensional Monitor Service\u201d refers to a group or organization from a dimension other than the one Dan is currently in. Since Blote is confused by the *idea* of time travel, and time travel is a concept unfamiliar to him, it implies that Manny and Fiorello originate from a dimension where time travel isn't a standard or well-understood technology.\n\nD"

He\u2019s primarily motivated by protecting his paintings and demonstrating his cleverness.\n\nThe fight with Manny and Fiorello, the unexpected appearance of the time machine, and finally, the encounter with Dzhackoon \u2013 an interdimensional monitor \u2013 completely disrupt his carefully constructed fa\u00e7ade. He\u2019s forced to abandon his original plan, acknowledge the absurdity of his situation, and reveal his underlying motives (which are, frankly, quite foolish and driven by ego). He\u2019s no longer in control, and his earlier confidence is shattered.
