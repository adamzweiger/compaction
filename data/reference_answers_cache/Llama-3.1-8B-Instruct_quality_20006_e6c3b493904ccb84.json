      "generated_text": "The author is criticizing the people involved in the scandal for their actions and inactions, suggesting that they are not entirely innocent. The author mentions that some individuals, like Betty Currie and Paul Begala, did not quit their jobs on principle, implying that they should have taken a stand against Clinton's actions. The author also criticizes those who were aware of the scandal but did not speak out, such as Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal, who spun Clinton's denials without bothering to check if they were true.\n\nThe author does not mention loyalty to Clinton as a requirement for these individuals, so option B is unlikely. Option C is also not relevant, as the author is not criticizing the timing of when they alerted the media. Option D is also not the main point, as the author is not focusing on who knew what and when.\n\nConsidering the author's tone and the criticisms made, the most likely answer is that the author believes the blame falls on those who did not take a principled stance against Clinton's actions, even if they were not directly involved.\n\nA."

The text lists several reasons for this, including her seducing a married man, damaging and endangering the presidency, lying frequently, and blabbing her \"secret\" affair to many people. \n\nThe text does not specifically mention that the public faults Monica for embarrassing the nation or hurting Chelsea. While it does mention that her affair damaged the presidency, this is framed as one of her negative actions, not the reason for the public's negative view of her.\n\nThe text does mention that Monica got caught, but this is presented as one of the consequences of her actions, not the primary reason for the public's negative view of her.\n\nThe text does mention that Monica blabbed her \"secret\" affair to many people, which is listed as one of her negative actions. However, the text also notes that it was her own loquaciousness that made it possible for her to be dragged into the scandal.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely reason for the public's negative view of Monica is that she told too many people about her affair.\n\nC"

The reasons for this sympathy include being lied to, betrayed, and cuckolded by her husband, and being personally humiliated. However, her rating is not the highest, suggesting that she is not viewed as entirely innocent or entirely sympathetic.\n\nChelsea Clinton's rating is +10, which indicates that she is viewed with a great deal of sympathy. The reasons for this sympathy include being humiliated and embarrassed by her father's misbehavior, having her family problems paraded before the world in a way they should not be, being endlessly psychologized by the media, and having her summer vacation ruined.\n\nThe key difference between the two is that Hillary Clinton is viewed as having made a \"Faustian bargain\" by protecting her husband, which reduces her sympathy rating. Chelsea Clinton, on the other hand, is viewed as an innocent victim of her father's actions.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD"
