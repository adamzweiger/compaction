Dennis mentions that he's lost count of the times he's read Marla's last letter.\n2. The letter mentions that Dennis has accepted a new assignment and that he's sailing on a new assignment.\n3. Dennis says, \"I did love you.... Good-by.\"\n\nFrom this information, we can infer that Marla is ending their relationship.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. There's no mention of Marla leaving for a new job.\nB. Dennis mentions a night in the Jovian Chamber, but it's not explicitly stated that this is why Marla left him.\nC. There's no mention of infidelity on Dennis' part.\nD. The text explicitly states that Marla mentions that the loss of Space was quite as deadly as the loss of Dennis, and that she says, \"I'm afraid I can offer no competition to the beauties of five planets\u2014or is it six?\"\n\nThis suggests that Marla feels she can't compete with the many women Dennis has encountered in his space travels.\n\n**D**"

The story mentions that the character Dennis Brooke is at the International Police (I.S.P.) headquarters on Terra, which is also referred to as Earth.\n\n2. This is indicated by the phrase \"The stern, white-haired I.S.P. Commander behind the immense Aluminil desk, frowned slightly as Dennis Brooke entered.

Commander, was aware of Dennis' grounding.\n3. Despite this, Commander Bertram decided to send Dennis on a mission to capture Koerber.\n\nGiven these points, the most logical reason for Dennis being sent on the mission is that it was likely to be deadly, as it required him to confront a notorious space pirate, Koerber. This type of mission would be a high-risk endeavor, and the Commander might have considered it a suitable opportunity for Dennis to redeem himself despite his grounding.\n\n**D**"

He disliked flying lightning fast - This is not mentioned in the passage as a reason.\nB. He'd never spent sleepless nights in eternal vigilance - This is also not mentioned as a reason.\nC. He did not have his usual luxurious office onboard - This is true, but it's not the reason why the journey was not a new adventure for the captain.\nD. He was the only one who had been to the outer planets before - This is implied in the passage, as it states \"their first assignment to duty in a search that went beyond the realm of the inner planets\", suggesting that Captain Brooke has been to the outer planets before.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\nD"

Dennis had a personal stake in the mission, as Marla, his fianc\u00e9e, was a passenger on the ship that was attacked by Koerber.\n2. Randall's failure to respond to the Captain's orders caused the I.S.P. Cruiser to be trapped by Koerber's magnetic beam.\n3. Dennis is aware that Randall is a young and inexperienced crew member, and he seems to understand that Randall's behavior was likely due to fear and inexperience.\n\nConsidering these points, Dennis' sympathy for Randall is likely due to his understanding of Randall's inexperience and fear, which led him to make a critical mistake.\n\n \nC"

This suggests that the shadow was caused by a massive object that was exerting a strong gravitational pull.\n\nThe options can be evaluated as follows:\n\nA. A transport ship: This is unlikely, as a transport ship would not be massive enough to create such a strong gravitational pull.\n\nB. A large planet: This is a possibility, as a large planet could create a significant gravitational pull.\n\nC. An asteroid: This is unlikely, as an asteroid would not be massive enough to create a strong enough gravitational pull to trap the I.S.P. Cruiser.\n\nD. A small planet: This is unlikely, as a small planet would not be massive enough to create a strong enough gravitational pull.\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely answer is B.

Marla was on a passenger spacer that left Venus with cargo and passengers, including herself.\n2. The spacer sent distress signals, but contact was lost, and it was never seen again.\n3. The story implies that the spacer was attacked by Koerber's pirate crew, as evidenced by the mention of Genton shells and the fact that the I.S.P. believes the pirate was involved.\n\nConsidering these points, it is likely that Marla and the other passengers were on the spacer that was attacked and destroyed. \n\nTherefore, she is most likely drifting in space, possibly in very small pieces."

There is no indication that the Martian's hatred is due to a general dislike of Terrans as a group (option A).\n2. The story does not provide any information about the significance of hazel eyes on Mars, so option B is unlikely.\n3. The passage mentions that the Mercurian Dancer is trying to get Dennis' attention, but it does not suggest that the Martian is jealous of Dennis because of her (option C).\n4. There is no mention of a billiards game or a debt between Dennis and the Martian, so option D is not supported by the text.\n\nBased on the information provided, the most plausible explanation for the Martian's hatred is that he is motivated by a personal reason, which is not explicitly stated in the passage. However, considering the context, it is likely that the Martian's hatred is related to Dennis' actions or behavior, which is not specified in the passage. Given the options provided, I will choose option C, as it is the only one that suggests a personal reason for the Martian's hatred, even though the passage does not fully support it.\n\n**C**"

The dancer approaches Dennis and flings herself in his lap, trying to get his attention.\n3. A Martian, who is revealed to be a member of Koerber's pirate crew, becomes aggressive and attacks Dennis.\n4. Dennis fights off the Martian and is left with a broken glass.\n\nAfter the fight, the dancer is mentioned again when Dennis is being taken away by the police:\n\n\"Some of the guests laughed, others stared in plain envy at the handsome, red-haired spacer, but from the table across, came the tinkling sound of a fragile glass being crushed in a powerful hand, and a muffled Martian curse. Without warning, the Martian was on his feet with the speed of an Hellacorium, the table went crashing to one side as he leaped with deadly intent on the sprawled figure of Dennis Brooke. A high-pitched scream brought instant silence as a Terran girl cried out. Then the Martian's hand reached out hungrily. But Dennis was not there. Leaping to one side, impervious to the fall of the dancer, he avoided the murderous rush of the Martian, then he wheeled swiftly and planted a sledge-hammer blow in that most vulnerable spot of all Martians, the spot just below their narrow, wasp-like waist, and as the Martian half-doubled over, he lefted him with a short jab to the chin that staggered and all but dropped him.\n\nThe Mercurian Dancer was not mentioned again in the passage until the scene at the I.S.P. Commander's office, where Dennis is discussing his chance to redeem himself by capturing Koerber. There is no description of her reaction to Dennis' victory over the Martian.\n\nHowever, based on her character, it is likely that she would be more concerned with her job and the tips she receives from the guests than with the outcome of the fight.\n\n**D**"
