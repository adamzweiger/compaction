The city was discovered by an interplanetary flight, which implies that it is on another planet.\n2. The passage mentions that the planet is \"without any life at all, save tiny mosses, for a million years or more.\"\n3. It is stated that \"no matter which direction from the city a man moved, he would always be going north.\"\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that the city is located at the north pole of the planet, as moving in any direction from the city would always result in moving north.\n\n**D**"

      "generated_text": "The story mentions that the expedition had 13 hours left to return to the ship when they discovered the city. It also mentions that they have 7 hours left when they are at the bottom level of the city. \n\n13 hours (initial time left) - 7 hours (time left at the bottom level) = 6 hours\n\nHowever, this 6 hours is the time they spent in the city, exploring and trying to find a way out. This doesn't directly answer the question, but we can infer that the time spent in the city is part of the 13 hours. \n\nGiven that they are at the bottom level of the city with 7 hours left, and they have been exploring for 6 hours, it's likely that the discovery of the city occurred around 7-8 hours after landing. This would put the discovery of the city around the 5-6 hour mark, but since the story doesn't give us an exact time, we can make an educated guess.\n\nAssuming the discovery occurred around the 5-6 hour mark, and considering the time it takes to walk to the city, explore the city, and reach the bottom level, it's likely that Wass activated the switchboard at the 10 hour mark.\n\n**B**"

The text mentions Martin's thoughts when he saw the city: \"He wondered, again, what beings would choose to build a city\u2014even a city like this one\u2014in such surroundings.\"\n2. Martin is thinking about the city's appearance and the beings that built it.\n3. Martin is considering the idea of parallel evolution on two inner planets of the same system, and a common ancestor.\n4. Martin grins at himself, at his own imagination, as he thinks about this idea.\n\nConsidering these steps, the most likely reason for Martin's smile is that he is imagining the aliens being man's ancestors, which is a humorous and unlikely idea.\n\nA."

Martin and Rodney had been trying to escape the city, and they had finally found a way out.\n2. They were relieved and happy to be escaping.\n3. However, when Martin turned on his radio to communicate with Rodney, he heard Wass' screams and then the sound of breaking glass, which indicated that Wass had sacrificed himself to help them escape.\n4. Martin was shocked and saddened by Wass' sacrifice.\n\nGiven this context, Martin's sickness is most likely due to the knowledge of Wass' sacrifice.\n\n**A**"

They have to take into account getting back to their mother ship and getting it out of the atmosphere during that 13-hour window, as well. - This is a crucial factor, but it is not explicitly stated in the text as something they don't take into account.\n\nD. The planet makes them forget time. - This is not mentioned in the text.\n\nHowever, it is mentioned that Wass disagrees with Martin's statement, \"We still have eleven hours to find a way out.\" Wass says, \"Ten hours and forty-five minutes,\" which implies that they are not accounting for the time it takes to get back to the ship, land, stow it, get themselves aboard, and get the big ship away from the planet.\n\nSo, the answer is: C"

Wass is the one who left the camera behind in the lifeboat, but this is not the reason for him being sent back to the lifeboat.\n2. There is no mention of anyone being injured, so option B is unlikely.\n3. The story does not suggest that Wass' attitude is bringing the others down; in fact, his suggestion to dig into the city is a crucial part of finding a way out.\n4. The text does not explicitly state that Wass is sent back to the lifeboat, but rather, he decides to leave the others and go back to the lifeboat on his own.\n\nConsidering the given options and the analysis, I'm going to guess that Wass decides to leave the others and go back to the lifeboat on his own.\n\n**C**"

They eventually realize that the dust is just air currents moving through the city.\n8. The crew finds a hatch that leads to a vast underground area filled with dust.\n9. They decide to search for a way out of the city and eventually find a grate that leads to a pipe, which they use to escape.\n10. They emerge from the city, and their crewmates from the mother ship come to rescue them.\n\nConsidering these points, the crew seems to be dealing with a complex, alien city that is likely a machine or a structure built by an advanced civilization, rather than a natural or magical place.\n\n**B**"
