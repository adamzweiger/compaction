As they traveled, Ninon felt herself becoming younger, but Robert did not seem to be experiencing the same effect.\n3. When Ninon asked Robert if he felt younger, he did not answer, and later, when she asked him again, he said she was looking her age, every year of her 52.\n4. In response to Robert's statement, Ninon shot him with a beta-gun, turning him into a motionless, glowing figure that rapidly became misty and wraith-like, eventually disappearing as its particles drifted to the metallite walls of the ship.\n\nBased on this information, the correct answer is:\n\nC"

Ninon is described as being 52 years old, but her physical appearance suggests she is much younger.\n2. She has access to various means of maintaining her youth, such as exercising machines, lotions, unguents, diets, and radioactive drugs.\n3. However, she dismisses these methods as \"toys\" and \"mirages of a pseudo-youth\".\n4. Ninon is interested in the concept of manipulating time and has been reading a book on \"Time in Relation to Time\".\n5. She uses this knowledge to her advantage when she travels with Robert, manipulating the time-space continuum to travel faster than light speed.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that Ninon's youthfulness is not due to her own efforts or access to conventional youth-maintaining technologies. Instead, it appears that her youthful appearance is a result of her manipulation of time-space through faster-than-light travel.\n\n**A**"

He was further shocked when she revealed her plan to use the ship to travel back in time and regain her youth.\n4.

The spaceship traveled past the planets in the solar system, including Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.\n2. After passing these planets, the ship entered the galaxy and traveled through the stars, reaching a point where it was halfway to the point where it would return to Earth.\n3. At this point, the ship was traveling at a speed of many times the speed of light, and Ninon was experiencing the effects of time dilation, which caused her to grow younger.\n4. The ship then began to decelerate and eventually returned to the solar system, where it landed on a planet that was not one of the original planets, indicating that the ship had traveled to a different point in space-time.\n\nGiven this information, it is not possible to determine the exact duration of the flight in Earth years. However, we can estimate that the ship traveled through the solar system, into the galaxy, and back again, which would take a significant amount of time, likely measured in decades or even centuries.\n\nTherefore, I'm going to guess:\n\nA"

It also mentions that the ship was heading out of the system and into the steely blackness of space where the stars were hard, burnished points of light. This suggests that they were traveling to a distant galaxy.\n\nThe story also mentions that when they decelerated and returned to their system, they saw that the planets had changed, specifically that Saturn had lost its rings. This implies that they had traveled to a different point in space-time.\n\nThe story also mentions that when they landed, people were discussing the ship and speculating about its origin. One person suggested that it was from a parallel time stream, where there was a system with planets and peoples like them. This implies that there may be other civilizations with space travel, but it is not explicitly stated.\n\nHowever, there is no mention of other civilizations with space travel that Earth was aware of before Ninon and Robert's journey.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: B."

The story mentions that Robert is a young spaceman who is about to embark on an experimental flight in a ship with a new, faster-than-light drive.\n2. He is going on this flight to test the new drive and find out how many times faster than light they can travel.\n3. Robert is motivated by a desire to explore the universe and push the boundaries of space travel.\n4. There is no indication that he wants to follow in his father's footsteps or escape his life on Earth.\n\nConsidering these points, we can infer that Robert's primary motivation for going to space is to explore and push the boundaries of space travel, which is closely related to option C. He is also indirectly motivated by the potential to achieve eternal youth, but that is not his primary goal.\n\nHowever, since the story does not explicitly state that he wants eternal youth, and his primary motivation is to explore space, I will choose the option that is closest to his actual motivation.\n\nC"

She is also shown to be intelligent and calculating, as she uses her knowledge of time and physics to manipulate Robert and achieve her goals. Additionally, she is willing to go to great lengths, including killing Robert, to achieve her desires, which indicates a level of desperation.\n\nShe is not particularly shown to be focused on being kind or forgiving, and her actions are more focused on self-preservation and personal gain.\n\nConsidering these traits, the options that best describe Ninon are:\n\nShe is charismatic and beautiful, as described by Robert and the general perception of her, but the text does not portray her as particularly kind.\n\nThe option that best fits Ninon's personality and actions is D."

Ninon is a 52-year-old woman who is desperate to regain her youth, and she sees Robert as a means to achieve that goal. She is willing to manipulate and use him to get what she wants.\n2. Robert is a young spaceman who is in love with Ninon, but he is also aware of her age and is initially shocked and horrified by her true age.\n3. Ninon uses her manipulation and cunning to blackmail Robert into taking her with him on his space mission, threatening to reveal information that could ruin his career.\n4. Despite his initial reluctance, Robert agrees to take Ninon with him, and she uses the opportunity to travel faster than light, which, according to her understanding of the theory, would make her younger.\n5. However, as they travel, Robert becomes increasingly uncomfortable with Ninon's behavior and her use of him, and he eventually becomes a target for her manipulation.\n6. In the end, Ninon kills Robert using a beta-gun, which suggests a complete lack of emotional attachment or care for his well-being.\n\nBased on these observations, the relationship between Ninon and Robert is primarily one of manipulation and exploitation, with Ninon using Robert to achieve her goals and Robert becoming increasingly uncomfortable and eventually a target for her manipulation.\n\n**D**"

Ninon is described as a woman who is determined to maintain her youth and beauty at any cost. She has a collection of recordings of herself with men, suggesting she uses them for her own purposes.\n2. Robert visits Ninon, and they engage in a romantic encounter, but Ninon's primary interest is in using him for her own gain. She records their encounter to blackmail him into taking her with him on his space flight.\n3. Ninon's plan is to use the recording to convince Robert to take her on the flight, and she successfully manipulates him into doing so.\n4. During the flight, Ninon's behavior is more focused on her own desires and goals (to regain her youth) rather than on Robert or their relationship.\n5. When Robert starts to look older again, Ninon becomes enraged and kills him with a beta-gun, suggesting she doesn't truly care for him.\n\nBased on this analysis, it appears that Ninon sees Robert as a means to an end, and their relationship is not based on mutual love or care for each other.\n\n**B**"

This would have likely made it difficult or impossible for her to withstand the effects of the light drive, which caused her to grow younger.\n\nHowever, this isn't explicitly stated in the passage, so I'll consider the other options:\n\nA. This option implies that Ninon's age wouldn't have affected her relationships or happiness. However, the passage suggests that Ninon's age was a significant factor in her relationships, particularly with Robert.\n\nB. This option implies that Robert's willingness to go along with Ninon's plan was based on her youth and beauty. If Ninon had been older, Robert might have been less willing to cooperate with her.\n\nC. This option is plausible, as Ninon's vanity and desire for youth were significant motivations for her actions. If she had been older and more accepting of her age, she might have felt more fulfilled.\n\nD. This option is the most likely consequence of Ninon not having had as many procedures. Her body would have been more fragile and less able to withstand the physical strain of space travel, making it unlikely that she could have hijacked the flight.\n\nD"
