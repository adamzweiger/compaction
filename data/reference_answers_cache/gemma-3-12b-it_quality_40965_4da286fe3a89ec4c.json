She had access to other space technologies to keep her youthful from blackmailing the Commander:** The story mentions she blackmailed the Commander but doesn't explicitly state she used this for advanced anti-aging technology. It seems like a possible interpretation, but not directly supported.\n*   **B. She was not youthful on Earth:** This contradicts the entire premise of the story. Ninon *believed* she was maintaining her youthfulness.\n*   **C. She had painstakingly disciplined herself to keep wrinkles from forming:** This is true, she worried about wrinkles and tried to avoid actions that would cause them. However, this was a minor, superficial effort compared to her ultimate plan.\n*   **D. She had travelled at light speed once before with Robert\u2019s dad:** The story's plot revolves around her traveling *faster* than light speed to reverse age. There's no mention of previous time-altering travel.\n\nThe key to Ninon's (attempted) youthfulness is her plan to travel faster than light. The story states that traveling faster than light would cause a person to grow younger.\n\nC"

While I grow younger, too, into a boy, then a child, a baby, at last nothing.'\" This demonstrates shock and understanding of the elaborate plan.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\nB"

She believed that returning to Earth many, many years in the future there would be technologies to make humans live forever:** There's no mention of future technologies saving her.\n*   **C. Eternal youth was what she believed she would achieve in death:** The passage describes her desire for youth *before* death, not after.\n*   **D. Once traveling faster than light was possible, she thought she might continually do this to remain young:** This is the key. She explicitly states she would continually travel faster than light, understanding that it would make her grow younger, implying repeated trips were necessary to maintain youth indefinitely.\n\nD"

There was one other civilization that Earth knew had space travel:** While the mention of \"Maris, the red planet\" implies another possible location, it's unclear if this signifies a civilization with advanced space travel.\n*   **C.

We don\u2019t know for sure from the story:** The story doesn't explicitly state why Robert wants to go to space.

Initially, Robert states they are \"Barely crawling, astronomically\" and \"approaching the speed of light.\" This implies they're *near* but not exceeding it yet.\n\n2. Later, Ninon demands the ship go \"faster! And faster and faster...\" and Robert replies, \"We are approaching the speed of light.\"\n\n3. Following that, Ninon wants it to go \"much faster!\" and Robert says, \"Nearly twice light speed.\" This indicates they've exceeded the speed of light *once* and are now traveling at roughly twice that speed.\n\n4. Finally, Ninon pushes for even more speed and Robert reports they're travelling \"many times the speed of light\".\n\nTherefore, the spaceship traveled faster than the speed of light at least twice (once approaching, and then at twice the speed) and then many times the speed of light. So, the best answer reflecting the progression and exceeding of the speed of light multiple times is thrice.\n\n\n\nA"

He finds her beautiful and wants to remember her image. He's upset when she resists his advances and seems genuinely concerned about her aging.\n*   **Ninon's feelings:** Ninon manipulates Robert's emotions and desires to achieve her goal of traveling faster than light.

She seems to view him as a means to an end rather than a genuine romantic partner.\n*   **Power dynamic:** There's a clear power imbalance. Ninon is significantly older and more experienced, and she exploits Robert\u2019s youth and infatuation. The final scene reveals that Robert is manipulated, and that his participation is not based on affection, but due to Ninon's calculated actions.\n\nConsidering these points, option A is closest to the truth. Robert does care for Ninon, and he spends his last night with her. However, Ninon uses his feelings and resources for her own selfish purpose. Option B is also close but it doesn't capture the depth of Robert's feelings. C and D are inaccurate.\n\nA"

A woman attempts to hijack the flight of an astronaut she's in love with so they can both stay young and beautiful together forever.** This is *partially* true. She does try to take the flight and wants to stay young, but the motivation isn't explicitly about love for the astronaut, more about her own vanity.\n\n*   **B. A vain woman has a tough time accepting the natural aging process but eventually succeeds.** This is closer. The story focuses heavily on the woman's obsession with youth and her attempts to avoid aging. The ending suggests she *thought* she succeeded, but the twist reveals otherwise.\n\n*   **C. A woman has a plan to reverse her aging process and the reader sees her follow through with it.** This is quite accurate. The story details her elaborate plan involving faster-than-light travel, and we witness her actions to implement it. The twist at the end is key.\n\n*   **D. A woman tries to benevolently prove that people can become younger through space travel.** This is incorrect. Her actions are selfish and driven by vanity, not a desire to help others.\n\nConsidering the detailed plan, the focus on reversing aging, and the ultimate tragic irony, **C** is the most accurate summary.\n\n\n\nC"

She would've dated somebody her age rather than Robert and would be happy anyway.** This is possible, but the story emphasizes Ninon's relentless pursuit of youth and her obsession with defying time. It's unlikely she would settle for a relationship with someone her age, as that would represent an acceptance of aging she actively fought against.\n\n*   **B. She wouldn't have been able to hijack the flight because Robert wouldn't want to date someone as old as her.** This is a strong contender. Robert's attraction to her hinges, at least partially, on her perceived youthfulness. Without the procedures, his interest would likely diminish, making the hijacking scenario impossible.\n\n*   **C. She would've looked older and probably would've felt more fulfilled.** While she might have felt more fulfilled accepting her age, the core of her character is her desperate desire for eternal youth. This makes this option less likely.\n\n*   **D. She wouldn't have been able to hijack the flight because her body would've been too old to take on the damage that space travel causes.** This is also very plausible. Space travel, particularly at the speeds described, would be extremely taxing on the body. An older, less maintained body would be far less likely to survive the journey.\n\nComparing B and D, option D is more directly related to the *physical* requirements of the spaceflight which is central to the plot. While B is logically plausible, D focuses on a physical limitation the story suggests exists.\n\nD"

Robert would've sneakily gone by himself to the takeoff and ditched Ninon.** This is unlikely. Robert appears to be relatively compliant and follows Ninon's lead, even when uncomfortable. Sneaking away isn't in his character as portrayed.\n\n*   **B. Ninon would've shot and killed him because he'd become useless in her endeavors.** This is *very* plausible. Ninon is ruthless and primarily motivated by her own desire for eternal youth. Robert's refusal would directly obstruct her goal, and she's shown willingness to use violence (shown by her almost shooting him) to get what she wants.\n\n*   **C. Ninon would've held him at gunpoint or drugged him until they had successfully completed takeoff.** This is also a possibility, aligning with her manipulative and forceful nature. It's a viable alternative to killing him if she felt she could control him.\n\n*   **D. Ninon would've talked him into it anyway because he's so dearly in love with her.** This is the least likely. While Robert is infatuated, the story emphasizes Ninon's control and manipulation. He's a pawn, not a willing participant, and she isn't shown as someone who patiently persuades.\n\nGiven Ninon's ruthless ambition and demonstrated willingness to resort to extreme measures, option B seems most probable. Option C is a close second. However, B more accurately captures the potential outcome given her overall character.\n\nB"

The recording shows a staged scene designed to manipulate Robert, not a genuine display of affection.\n*   **B. It was to prove that Ninon thinks little of Robert because he\u2019s easily replaceable as a romantic partner.** This aligns perfectly with the scene. She's demonstrating that he's just a tool to achieve her goal, and she can easily find another man to use. The condescending tone and the reference to easily replacing him support this.\n*   **C. It was to show how much thought Ninon has put into making her plan and how determined she is to see it succeed.** While it *does* reveal her planning, the primary purpose isn't to showcase her strategic thinking, but to manipulate Robert.\n*   **D. It was to prove that everyone makes mistakes, and that Ninon is comfortable admitting that she\u2019s not perfect.** This is completely contrary to Ninon's character. She is portrayed as manipulative and power-hungry, not someone who readily admits flaws.\n\nTherefore, the narrative purpose is to highlight Ninon's disdain for Robert and her willingness to use him.\n\nB"
