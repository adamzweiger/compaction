The author argues that people often confuse this principle with the idea that genetic relationship is necessary for love or altruism.\n\nThe author identifies several misconceptions about kin selection, including:\n\n* Genes being smart and able to positively identify kin (Misconception No. 1)\n* People being smart and able to consciously recognize genetic relationship (Misconception No. 2)\n* Genes being efficient in their selfishness (Misconception No. 3)\n\nThe author argues that these misconceptions lead to a confused exaltation of genetic affinity, which is not supported by the scientific evidence.\n\nConsidering the options, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Humans are capable of treating anyone as kin"

Instead, bonding plays a crucial role in forming love, as seen in the example of the woman who bonded with Kimberly Mays, despite not being her biological mother. The author also mentions that adoptive parents can form strong bonds with their children, and that genetic mothers can miss out on bonding opportunities. This suggests that bonding is a more significant factor in human capacity to love than genetic relationship.\n\nC"

The author explains that kin-selection is a process where genes for altruism, such as love and affection towards kin, spread through the population because they increase the chances of the gene's survival.\n2. The author mentions that this process led to the proliferation of genes for love and affection towards kin, such as siblings, parents, and children.\n3. However, the author also explains that these genes for kinship are now widespread throughout the human population, meaning that everyone has them.\n4.

This is evident in the statement \"For example, you might, after observing the natural behavior of praying mantises, be tempted to conclude that it is morally good for females to eat males after sex--and this, I submit, would be a repugnant and wrongheaded doctrine!\"\n\nThe author concludes that just because something is natural, it doesn't necessarily mean it's good or ethical.\n\n**B**"

This rule would misfire when the mother is nurturing a non-offspring, but it wouldn't have a significant impact on the overall genetic math favoring the gene's proliferation.\n\nThe same logic applies to a person raising a daughter from age 5. The bonding process begins at birth, and the author mentions that mothers can be \"fooled\" by factors correlated with kinship, such as nursing and sleeping next to the child. If a person starts raising a child at 5, they would have missed out on this early bonding time, which could make it tougher to connect with the child.\n\nA."
