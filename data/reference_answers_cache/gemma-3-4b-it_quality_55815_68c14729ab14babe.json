Amy\u2019s role was merely to take notes and assist Mal. Peggy\u2019s involvement was limited to expressing encouragement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nC"

We learn that Randy Brewster wrote the play, and Mal Seton is the director. There\u2019s a romantic element with Peggy and Randy, and a storyline about a young actress, Paula Andrews, vying for the lead role. Amy, Peggy\u2019s housemate, is also trying for a part.

Many are dismissed based purely on their appearance.\n2. **Elimination Based on Looks:** Mal and Randy repeatedly eliminate actors who don\u2019t fit the physical description of the roles, even if they possess acting talent.\n3. **Subsequent Readings:** After the initial typecasting, actors who pass the look test are given scripts and asked to read for the roles.\n4. **Importance of Fit:** Mal emphasizes that the *characters* require a specific look, and that a good actor won\u2019t overcome a mismatch. He\u2019s willing to discard a potentially brilliant actor if their appearance doesn\u2019t align with the vision.\n5. **Randy\u2019s Involvement:** Randy, the author, has a particularly complicated connection to the project, adding another layer of potential bias.\n\nConsidering these points, the story highlights that initial appearance is a significant factor, and actors must fit the *visual* requirements of the roles before being considered for a reading. Acting ability is important, but only *after* the look is deemed appropriate.\n\n**C**"

The text states that Mal and Randy \u201csettled themselves at a table near the windows, spread out scripts and pads and pencils, and prepared for the chore that faced them.\u201d This suggests they are actively involved in the process.\n2. Randy is described as \u201cthe author of the play.\u201d This implies a connection to the material being auditioned.\n3. The text indicates that Mal and Randy \u201clooked them over, murmured to Amy to take notes, and asked questions.\u201d This shows they are evaluating the actors.\n4.

She\u2019s aware of Mal and Randy\u2019s potential bias due to their friendship.\n\n2. **Her Concerns:** Throughout the passage, Peggy repeatedly expresses worry about proving herself to her parents and the financial struggle of pursuing acting. She\u2019s acutely aware of the need for a \u201cbig\u201d role and a steady income.\n\n3. **Randy\u2019s Involvement:** Randy is the author of the play, and he seems to have a genuine connection with Peggy, potentially suggesting a favored treatment.\n\n4. **Mal\u2019s Fairness:** Mal is explicitly concerned about not showing favoritism, actively trying to avoid bias.\n\n5. **The Tone:** The text has a somewhat melancholic and realistic tone. It highlights the challenges of the acting world and the potential for disappointment.\n\nConsidering these points, option B \u2013 she\u2019d probably be happy for a short bit, but then stressed that it wouldn't be enough to prove herself to her parents \u2013 is the most plausible. Getting a role would bring an initial surge of joy, but the underlying pressure to succeed and satisfy her parents\u2019 expectations would quickly resurface. The other options are less likely given the story's emphasis on Peggy\u2019s anxieties and the competitive nature of the industry.\n\nD"

She'd find another role quickly because she has good connections and networking skills.** The passage highlights Peggy\u2019s connections with Mal and Randy. However, it also emphasizes that securing this particular role is difficult due to the number of applicants and the subjective nature of the casting decisions. While she has connections, this specific role is a challenge.\n\n*   **B. She'd try to secure a role within four months.** The passage states she\u2019s aiming to stay in New York for a year, with an assessment at the end of that period. Four months is a reasonable timeframe for further auditions and seeking other opportunities.\n\n*   **C. A new role wouldn't be guaranteed, but she'd convince Randy to write her into a future play.** The passage suggests a complicated dynamic with Randy \u2013 a close friendship tinged with potential romantic interest. While Peggy *might* try this, it\u2019s not the most immediate or probable outcome if she doesn't land this role. It\u2019s a longer-term, less certain strategy.\n\n*   **D. She'd get the approval from her parents to stay for an extra year; they want the best for her and believe in her skills.** Peggy\u2019s parents are explicitly stated to be \u201cpractical\u201d and to want her to succeed, but they\u2019ve already agreed to a one-year trial. Getting an extension would require a demonstrable success \u2013 which this role would have provided.\n\nConsidering the timeline, Peggy's desire to prove herself to her parents, and the difficulty of the casting process, the most logical outcome is that she\u2019d actively seek other roles within a reasonable timeframe.\n\nB"

Amy shares this sentiment. This suggests a compassionate, perhaps slightly anxious, nature.\n\n2. **Paula\u2019s Perspective:** Paula is desperately hoping for the lead role and worries about her appearance (\u201ctoo pretty\u201d).

The mention of Amy\u2019s work as a salesgirl and her feeling of needing to \u201cget rid of this Southern accent\u201d further supports the idea that she\u2019s consciously limiting her chances.\n\nD"

It delves into the personalities of the characters involved and their internal thoughts. The dialogue is realistic and portrays the subtle dynamics of the theater world\u2014friendships, competition, and the pressures of seeking a role. The descriptions of the setting, like the bare rehearsal studio and the coffeehouse, add to the atmosphere.\n\nNow let\u2019s consider the options:\n\n*   **A. A grandmother who wants to relate with her granddaughter who's entering the theater industry:** While a grandmother might enjoy it, the focus is more on the *process* of auditions than a general heartwarming story about a granddaughter\u2019s journey.\n\n*   **B. Someone who likes theater and enjoys thinking about the audition process and seeing it play out:** This is the strongest fit. The detailed descriptions and focus on the intricacies of casting perfectly align with someone interested in the mechanics and psychology of theater.\n\n*   **C. A male actor trying to see what the audition process feels like to actresses during their auditions:** The excerpt does offer a glimpse into the actress\u2019s perspective, but it\u2019s primarily focused on the overall experience rather than the specific challenges male actors might face.\n\n*   **D. A young child who dreams to be an actress and primarily wants to hear success stories:** The excerpt doesn't offer much in the way of success stories; it's mostly about the frustrations and uncertainties of the initial stages of a career.\n\n**B**"
