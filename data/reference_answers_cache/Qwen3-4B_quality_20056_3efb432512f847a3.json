The options are A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details from the text. The article talks about Nash's life. He was a mathematical genius, had a breakdown in his 30s, spent time in mental institutions, had delusions, and later recovered. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics. The key points are that he developed mental illness as an adult, had a long period of schizophrenia, but later improved. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA says he was born crazy but accomplished a lot. But the text says he was a genius and had a breakdown later, not born crazy. So A is probably wrong.\n\nB says he developed mental illness as an adult and never improved. But the text mentions that later he improved, especially in the '90s, and even won the Nobel. So B is incorrect.\n\nC says he pretended to be crazy. The text doesn't mention pretense; it's stated he was actually suffering from schizophrenia. So C is likely wrong.\n\nD says he developed mental illness as an adult but later improved. That matches the text, which says he had a breakdown in his 30s, spent time in asylums, but later recovered. So D is correct.\n</think>\n\nD"

The options are A to D.\n\nLooking at the text, the author starts by talking about how high IQs are linked to nearsightedness due to genetics, but then shifts to discussing mathematicians and their possible connection to madness. The author mentions several mathematicians like John Nash, Kurt G\u00f6del, and John Von Neumann who had mental health issues. There's a discussion about whether there's a pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. The author also describes Nash's life, his genius, and his descent into madness, and how he later recovered. \n\nThe author seems to suggest that mathematicians might be more prone to madness, given the examples and the discussion about the \"folie \u00e0 n\" (a French term for a collective delusion). The text also mentions that mathematicians deal with abstract concepts, which might be seen as hallucinatory, but the main point seems to be about the link between mathematical genius and mental instability. \n\nOption D says they are more likely to be crazy. The examples given support that view. The author doesn't just say they value abstract things (B) or that they all hallucinate (C), but rather that there's a connection between their genius and mental health issues.

The text says he stood out from his fellow math prodigies in appearance, so he didn't fit in well. That would make B false.

The text mentions that economists have won Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus, which might imply that Economics is easier? Wait, but the author also says that Nash's work in game theory was a breakthrough, but his fellow mathematicians didn't find it impressive. Then, the Nobel committee decided to award him the prize. \n\nThe key part is when the author says, \"Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus.\" That suggests that Economics might be easier because they're rediscovering existing theorems, whereas Math might require more original work. But the author is pointing out that Nash's work in game theory was a major contribution, but economists picked it up later. \n\nWait, the author says that Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by Rand, but it didn't impress his fellow mathematicians. Then, economists later made it a cornerstone. So maybe the author is implying that Economics is more accessible, hence easier to win a prize in? The question is about what the author says. The answer might be B: It is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math.

The options are A through D, each stating different things about whether mathematicians were wowed by his work.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the context provided. The passage mentions that Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by Rand Corporation. However, it also states that his achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. Then, later, he solved a problem related to manifolds, which was a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19th century. The passage says that his work on manifolds was so confusing that his fellow mathematicians were \"thoroughly befuddled.\" \n\nRegarding game theory, the text says that Nash's proof of the Nash equilibrium was considered elegant but slight, relying on a fixed-point theorem. It also mentions that economists later picked up game theory in the 1980s and made it a cornerstone. However, the passage explicitly states that his work at Rand didn't impress his peers. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA. Mathematicians were wowed by all of his work. But the text says his work at Rand didn't impress them, and his manifold proof was confusing. So A is probably incorrect.\n\nB. Mathematicians were wowed by his work at Rand Corporation. The passage says the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. So B is false.\n\nC. Mathematicians were wowed by his manifold proof. The text says his work on manifolds left them befuddled. So C is incorrect.\n\nD. Mathematicians were wowed by his game theory proof. The passage says that his game theory proof was considered elegant but slight, and that economists later made it a cornerstone. However, the text also says that his work at Rand didn't impress his peers. But the game theory proof was actually recognized later, leading to his Nobel. However, the passage says that when he presented his game theory proof, it was considered \"elegant but slight\" and that the theorem was already known. So maybe the mathematicians weren't wowed by it at the time. However, the question is about what is true. The passage says that his game theory proof was considered profound by economists, but the mathematicians might not have been wowed. However, the answer options might be tricky. \n\nWait, the passage says that Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by Rand, but that the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. However, the game theory proof was later recognized as profound. But the question is about what is true. The answer might be D, because the game theory proof was considered profound by economists, but the passage says that the mathematicians weren't impressed. However, the options are about whether mathematicians were wowed by his work. The passage says that the game theory proof was considered elegant but slight, and that the theorem was already known. So maybe D is not correct. \n\nBut the passage also says that Nash's game theory work was a major contribution, leading to his Nobel. However, the text says that his work at Rand didn't impress his peers. But the game theory proof itself was considered profound by economists. However, the question is about mathematicians. The passage says that when he presented his game theory proof, it was considered \"elegant but slight,\" and that the theorem was already known. So perhaps the mathematicians weren't wowed by it. However, the answer D says that mathematicians were wowed by his game theory proof. But according to the text, the mathematicians weren't impressed. Therefore, the correct answer might be D is incorrect. \n\nWait, the passage says: \"Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline.\" So the mathematicians were bored with game theory by the 1950s, but Nash's proof was considered elegant but slight. So maybe the mathematicians weren't wowed by his work. However, the answer D says that mathematicians were wowed by his game theory proof. \n\nBut the passage says that his game theory proof was considered \"elegant but slight,\" and that the theorem was already known. Therefore, the mathematicians might not have been wowed by it. However, the Nobel was awarded for game theory, which was his contribution. But the passage says that his work at Rand didn't impress his fellow mathematicians. Therefore, the correct answer might be D is incorrect. \n\nBut the passage says that Nash's game theory proof was considered profound by economists, but the question is about mathematic"

The options are A to D.\n\nLooking back at the text, there's a part that says: \"At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems.\" So, he was solving their problems, which might mean he was helping them, but in a harsh way. \n\nOption C says \"He helped graduate students solve problems,\" which seems to match that part. But the text also mentions he humiliated them, so maybe it's not just helping. However, the question is about how he was distinguished as a professor. The key part here is that he was given a teaching job, but he didn't bother with undergrads and humiliated grad students by solving their problems. So, the fact that he helped them solve their problems is mentioned, even if it was in a harsh manner. \n\nOption A says he was known for erratic behavior. The text does mention his erratic behavior, but the question is specifically about how he was distinguished as a professor. The text says he was a professor at MIT, but his behavior as a professor was more about solving their problems, even if it was harsh. \n\nSo the correct answer would be C. But wait, the text says he \"humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems.\" So maybe the answer is C, because he did help them solve problems, even if it was in a harsh way.

He did stints in tony asylums... He believed himself to be the emperor of Antarctica.\" So that's a delusion of being a leader of a continent. \n\nOption A is \"Being a refugee from Europe,\" which is mentioned as one of his delusions (C.O.R.P.S.E. is a Palestinian refugee). But the question asks for one of them. The answer options are separate. The question is which one is correct. The text explicitly states he believed he was the emperor of Antarctica, which is a leader of a continent. So D is correct.

The options are A to D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the context from the provided text. The passage mentions that Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia and had a history of mental instability. The Nobel Committee was deciding whether to award him the prize in economics for his work in game theory. The text says that Nasar penetrated the secrecy around the Nobel and revealed the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. \n\nThe key points here are that Nash was a \"known madman\" and that there were concerns about making a \"known madman\" into a laureate. The text also mentions that he had a history of mental illness, including episodes of psychosis, and that he was in a state of remission at the time. However, the concern was about his mental state during the ceremony.

He had killed animals as a child \u2013 This is mentioned in the text, but it's a past action and not directly related to the concern about giving him the prize. \n\nB. He was in remission from illness \u2013 The text says he was in remission in the '90s when he received the prize, but the concern was about giving the prize when he was still in remission. However, the text says that the Nobel committee was concerned about him being a \"known madman\" and that the concern was about his mental state during the ceremony. \n\nC. He might offend the dignitaries \u2013 The text says that Nash might say something to King Gustav at the ceremony, which could be a problem. But the main concern was more about his mental state rather than offending dignitaries. \n\nD. He had not worked for very long yet \u2013 The text says that Nash's work on game theory was done as a graduate student, and the Nobel was awarded for that. However, the concern was more about his mental health rather than the duration of his work. \n\nThe text explicitly states that the concern was about making a \"known madman\" into a laureate. The answer is likely C or D. However, the text says that the Nobel committee was deciding whether to award him because he was a \"known madman\" and that there were machinations for and against his candidacy. The specific reason mentioned is that he might say something to King Gustav at the ceremony, which is option C. Alternatively, the text says that the concern was about his mental state, but the options don't have that. The correct answer according to the text is C: He might offend the dignitaries. But wait, the text says that the concern was about his mental state, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, the answer is C because the text says \"what might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony?\" which implies that they were concerned he might offend dignitaries. However, the text also mentions that the Nobel committee was considering his mental state. But the answer options don't have that. The correct answer according to the text is C. Wait, the text says that the concern was about making a known madman into a laureate, but the answer options don't have that. The text says that Nasar shows her mettle by penetrating the secrecy and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. The answer is C: He might offend the dignitaries.

This suggests he became kinder, which would be option A. \n\nThen, there's a part where it says the Nobel has a terrible effect on many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. But for Nash, it was pure therapy. So that contradicts option B, which says he was paralyzed by it. The text says it was therapeutic for him, so B is probably not correct.\n\nOption C says he moved into a new house. The text mentions that the Nobel money bought a new boiler for his house, but that's a specific detail. However, the question is about the impact of the prize. Moving into a new house is a result, but the main impact discussed is his personal change. However, the question might consider C as a correct answer if the text explicitly states that. Wait, the text says \"The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow...\" but not necessarily a new house. So maybe C is not the main point.\n\nOption D is he felt helpless. The text says he was humbled by years of psychosis, but after the Nobel, he was \"humbled\" and \"buoyed up.\" So D doesn't fit.\n\nSo the main answer is A: He changed into a kinder man.

Also, he had a son with Alicia, and the Nobel money helped them. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA. He settled into family life. The text says he was taken care of by Alicia, had a son, and the Nobel helped them. So family life seems part of it.\n\nB. Oscillated between asylums and prison. The text mentions he had stints in asylums and was in insulin-induced comas, but not prison. The answer might not be B.\n\nC. Saw patterns in letters and numbers. The text mentions he thought aliens sent messages through the Times and had delusions, but not specifically about letters and numbers. However, he was a mathematician, so maybe that's part of his delusions. But the question is about themes in his later years. The Nobel award is mentioned, and his later years included some stability.\n\nD. Apologizing to those he wronged. The text says he was a \"very fine person\" after the Nobel, but doesn't mention him apologizing specifically. It mentions he was cruel to others in his earlier years, but not necessarily apologizing later.\n\nSo the correct answer is likely A. He settled into family life with Alicia and their son. The text also mentions the Nobel money helping them, so family life is a theme. The other options don't fit as well. B is partially true but the text doesn't mention prison. C is possible but not explicitly stated. D isn't mentioned. So the answer is A.\n</think>\n\nA"

The options are A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details from the text. The passage mentions that Nash was a mathematical genius initially. He made a breakthrough in game theory, which earned him respect. However, later, he started showing signs of mental illness. At Rand Corp., his achievement didn't impress his fellow mathematicians. Then, he was expelled from Rand for a lewd act. At MIT, he humiliated graduate students and had personal issues. His colleagues probably started to lose respect for him as his behavior worsened. Later, when he got the Nobel Prize, maybe his colleagues saw him again as a respected figure. The text says that after his breakdown, he was in institutions, but then he got the Nobel, which might have restored some respect. The answer might be A. \n\nOption C says he was initially respected but then rejected and died in an asylum. But the text says he didn't die in an asylum; he was taken care of by his wife and later had a remission. So C is incorrect. Option D says colleagues accepted his quirks, but the text shows that his behavior became more erratic, leading to rejection. Option B says his madness was never public, but the text mentions that his colleagues at MIT treated him poorly. So the correct answer is A.\n</think>\n\nA"

The options are A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the text. The author talks about Nash's behavior. In the part about his later life, there's mention of him being expelled from Rand Corp. because of a lewd act in a public men's room. Then, at MIT, he humiliated students, had affairs with men and a mistress, and even physically abused his wife. Also, he disrobed in public, wore a diaper to a party, and had delusions like thinking aliens sent him messages. There's also mention of him forming a world government, renouncing citizenship, and having various delusions. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nOption B says sending bombs, nudity, lewd public conduct. The text mentions he built homemade bombs and had a lewd act in a public men's room. But does it say he sent bombs? The text says he built them with two other kids, one of whom was killed. But the author says \"it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.\" So maybe that's part of it. But the question is about events that justified his undoing. \n\nOption C includes lewd public conduct, nudity, violence, and communications with extraterrestrials. The text mentions nudity (diaper at a party), lewd conduct (public men's room), violence (abused his wife), and communications with aliens (thinking messages from the NYT). \n\nOption B has sending bombs, which is mentioned, but the text says he built bombs but not necessarily sent them. The author says \"it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect,\" implying he might have been a suspect, but maybe that's not directly stated as an event. \n\nThe text also mentions his lewd act in the men's room, disrobing in public, violence against his wife, and communications with aliens. So option C seems to cover those points. Option B includes sending bombs, which might not be explicitly stated as an event that led to his undoing, but the text does mention his bomb-making. However, the answer might be C because the text specifically lists lewd public conduct, nudity, violence, and alien communications. The answer is C.\n</think>\n\nC"

The passage describes Nash's life, including his academic achievements and personal behavior. The user is asking specifically about his working habits. Let's look through the text for any mentions of his work habits.\n\nLooking at the sections about Nash's career: He was a math prodigy at Princeton, where he quickly made a breakthrough in game theory. He was recruited by Rand Corp. and later worked at MIT. The text mentions that he was expelled from Rand for a lewd act, but that's more about his personal life than work habits. \n\nThen there's a part where it says he was a \"cold and aloof Southerner\" and that he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. That suggests he might not have been collaborative, but the options don't mention that. \n\nAnother part mentions that he was involved in a lot of mathematical work, like solving problems and presenting talks. However, the text also talks about his mental health issues and how they affected his work, like his breakdown in 1959 where he presented a \"farrago of mathematical lunacy.\" \n\nLooking at the options: A is involving colleagues in round tables, which isn't mentioned. B is yelling in his office, which isn't directly stated. C is that it's never outlined, but the text does describe some aspects of his work. D is going on long retreats, which isn't mentioned either. \n\nWait, the text says he was expelled from Rand, but that's a personal incident. The passage also mentions that he was a \"handsome as a god\" and had a certain appearance, but that's about his looks. \n\nThe text does mention that he was a \"cold and aloof Southerner\" and that he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students. However, none of the options directly relate to that. The options given are A, B, C, D. \n\nThe answer might be C, but the text does describe some aspects of his work habits, like his interactions with students and his work at MIT. However, the question is about \"working habits,\" and the text doesn't explicitly list any specific habits. The answer might be C, but I need to check again. \n\nWait, the text says he was a \"cold and aloof Southerner\" and that he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students. But that's more about his personality than his working habits. The text also mentions that he was a mathematical genius but had issues with colleagues. However, the options don't include that. \n\nAlternatively, the text says that he was involved in solving problems, but the answer options don't include that. The correct answer might be C, but I'm not entirely sure. However, the text doesn't explicitly outline his working habits in detail, so maybe C is correct. Wait, the question is about what the text says. If the text doesn't mention any of the options, then C would be the answer. But the text does mention that he was a mathematical genius, worked at MIT, and had some interactions with students. However, the options don't include that. \n\nWait, the text says he was a \"cold and aloof Southerner\" and that he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students. But that's not one of the options. The options are A, B, C, D. The text doesn't mention any of the options except maybe D, but there's no mention of retreats. Therefore, the correct answer is C: It is never outlined. But I need to check again. \n\nWait, the text does mention that he was a mathematical genius, worked at Princeton, MIT, and had some interactions with colleagues. However, the options given are A, B, C, D. The answer is likely C because the text doesn't explicitly describe his working habits in detail, but the options might not be covered.

The options are A to D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the part where the fixed point theorem is mentioned. The text says that Nash's proof for the Nash equilibrium was based on a fixed-point theorem from topology. The theorem states that in a continuous rearrangement, there's a fixed point. Nash applied this to game theory, showing that every game has an equilibrium. \n\nThe question is asking what the fixed point's significance was in the story. The options are about whether it was his claim to fame, an analogy for his father, a turning point in his behavior, or something that was proven false and drove him mad.\n\nLooking at the text, the fixed point theorem was part of the mathematical proof for the Nash equilibrium. The story mentions that Nash's breakthrough in game theory was using this theorem. However, the fixed point itself wasn't directly related to his mental health or the turning point in his life. The fixed point was a mathematical concept that supported his proof, which led to his recognition in game theory. \n\nThe answer options: A says it was his claim to fame. Since his game theory work was his major achievement, and the fixed point theorem was part of that proof, maybe A is correct. But the text says that the fixed point theorem was used in the proof, but the actual claim to fame was the Nash equilibrium. However, the fixed point was part of the proof. \n\nAlternatively, the text mentions that the fixed point theorem was used, but the actual significance in the story is that it was part of his mathematical work. The story doesn't say that the fixed point was proven false; rather, Nash's application of it was correct.
