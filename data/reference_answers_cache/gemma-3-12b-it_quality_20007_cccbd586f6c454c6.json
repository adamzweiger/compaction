They know Clinton cheats on his wife:** While some people believed Clinton was unfaithful, this doesn't explain *why* they considered the specific story untrue. Belief in infidelity doesn't automatically invalidate a particular claim.\n*   **B. They were Clinton-haters:** Being a \"Clinton-hater\" might make someone *want* the story to be true, or to believe anything negative about him. It doesn't inherently mean they thought the story was false.\n*   **C. He could not have gotten back home without being found out:** This aligns directly with the text. The passage details the security measures in place\u2014Secret Service protection, gate checks, etc.\u2014that would make such a clandestine return highly improbable. This is the core reason for disbelief.\n*   **D. It was published by the Washington Times:** The publication doesn't inherently make a story untrue. While the source might be considered, the text focuses on the logistical impossibilities of the scenario.\n\nTherefore, the main reason the story was deemed untrue was due to the logistical challenges of Clinton circumventing security.\n\nC"

They always tried to hide it well:** The text mentions Kennedy \"hardly bothered to hide his conquests,\" and that reporters were aware but didn't publish. This option is partially true, but not the primary reason.\n*   **C. The secret service budget was small:** The text directly contrasts the smaller Secret Service of past eras with the significantly larger and more vigilant Secret Service of Clinton's time. This is a key factor.\n*   **D. The reporters never found out:** The text explicitly states that reporters *did* know, or strongly suspected, but didn't publish stories.

White House journalists knew about, or at least strongly suspected, Kennedy's infidelity, but never published a story about it.\" This aligns perfectly with the explanation.\n*   **B.

Only the oval office, bowling alley, or East Wing:** The text specifically states liaisons in the Oval Office, bowling alley, or East Wing are \"unimaginable.\"\n*   **D. Only the private quarters or the office restroom:** The article states the Oval Office bathroom is the only other place besides the private quarters where liaisons are possible, but it suggests this is only if the president is an exhibitionist or lunatic, making this option incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the one that aligns with the text's assertion that the private quarters are the *only* truly safe location.\n\nB"

Through the tunnel:** The text states the tunnel is \"too well-guarded\" and would attract too much attention.\n*   **D. Through the gate:** The text details a scenario where the president arranges for a visitor to enter through the East gate, going through security checks, but it's presented as a controlled, albeit risky, method.\n\nConsidering the text's discussion of security and the desire for discretion, entering through the gate with pre-arranged protocols (even with risks) seems the most plausible, albeit still difficult, method.\n\nA"

He would have to notify a cabinet member to get out of it:** The text doesn't mention needing to notify a cabinet member to avoid Secret Service protection.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is that the president chooses to have agents accompany him because it's practically unavoidable given the heightened security measures.\n\n\n\nB"

The agents will record the visit and make it public: The text mentions the visit is recorded in the Secret Service log, but it's not publicly released during the administration.

The number of people potentially aware increases significantly due to the larger group involved.\n*   **D.
