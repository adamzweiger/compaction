Not religious.\n\nLooking back at the text, Matheny was in the church where they were playing games. He tried playing craps but was probably not good at it. The story mentions he was awkward and maybe embarrassed when he was playing. But the key part is when he was in the church, he was playing craps and then got embarrassed because he was a Martian and the others were Earth people. The text says he was \"shuddering\" and \"burning ears\" after the lady told him it's a church. So he left because he was embarrassed. But wait, the options are C. Embarrassed. Alternatively, maybe he was not religious, but the text says he was in a church, but he wasn't religious. However, the immediate reason he left was because he was embarrassed by his own behavior in the game. The answer is C.\n</think>\n\nC"

The question is about why Matheny felt guilty when Doran bought the ring.\n\nLooking back at the text, when Doran talks about the ring, he says it's \"a jewel dug out of the City of Time, like, made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race.\" Matheny feels guilt because he's aware that such artifacts are scientifically priceless and shouldn't be sold. Earlier in the conversation, Matheny discusses the issues with selling Martian relics, mentioning that they are scientifically important and that selling them is a crime. \n\nSo, the guilt comes from the fact that the ring is a priceless artifact that shouldn't be sold. That points to option D. The other options don't fit. Doran had visited Mars (he's an Earthman but talks about Mars), the ring isn't fake, and it's not just old but has historical value.

The first is the \"Little Girl\" project, which was Junie O'Brien, a girl who collected Earth coins and was part of a con. Then there's the Red Ankh Society, which is described as a large dollar-earning enterprise that sells \"mysterious knowledge\" of the Old Martians. These are two different cons. \n\nWait, but there's also mention of the Billingsworth Expedition ruins being fake. But that's part of the setup for the con games they already operate. The two specific cons mentioned are the Little Girl (Junie O'Brien) and the Red Ankh Society. So that's two. The answer should be C.2.\n</think>\n\nC. 2"

Matheny is there to find an Earthman who can help them make more money through con games. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA. Martians wanted to start conning Earth. But the story says they already have con games. So maybe not A.\n\nB. Martians didn't know what a con was. But they do, as they're already doing it. So B is probably wrong.\n\nC. Martians were making a lot of money already. But the story mentions they need more. So C is incorrect.\n\nD. Martians were already conning Earth but needed help making more money.

Such as you.\" So he's saying that the girl is into exotics, and Matheny is considered exotic because he's from Mars. \n\nSo the answer should be A. He was exotic. The other options don't fit. B is about being a professor, but that's not why the girl is interested. C is about expense account, which isn't mentioned in the context of the girl.

Matheny is a Martian sent to Earth to find a business manager. The story describes his experiences on Earth. \n\nLooking at the text: When he first arrives, he mentions the gravity being hard to take. He says, \"The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.\" Then later, he says, \"His feet ached from the weight on them.\" So that's about gravity. But the options mention higher gravity hurting his feet. Wait, but he says the gravity was not as hard as expected. Maybe that's not the answer.\n\nThen there's the part about the air. He says, \"The air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean.\" So the air is thick, which would make breathing difficult. That's option D. \n\nAlso, his clothes are described as \"forty years out of date,\" which would make him feel embarrassed, so option B. But the question is about the hardest part. The story mentions that the air was a problem, and he had trouble breathing. Also, he had to deal with the atmosphere's thickness. \n\nAnother part: he was in a church, which was a cultural shock. But the options don't include that. The options are A, B, C, D. \n\nThe answer is likely D, the thick air. Because he explicitly mentions the air being heavy and hard to breathe. The other options are mentioned but maybe not as harsh. The gravity was a problem, but he said it wasn't as hard as expected. The clothes were outdated, but that's more about embarrassment than difficulty. The officials yelling might be a minor point. So the hardest part was the thick air.\n</think>\n\nD"

The options are A to D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relevant part of the story. The story mentions that Martians have a problem with gambling because of Earth's laws. Specifically, there's a conversation where Gus Doran talks about how Martians can't run a sweepstakes because Earth's laws forbid it. \n\nIn the text, Matheny explains that Mars wants to operate a sweepstakes but can't because of Earth's anti-gambling laws. So, the answer should be related to that. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA. Gambling was not allowed on Mars. But the story doesn't say that. Mars might have some gambling, but the issue is with Earth's laws. \n\nB. Martians couldn't run a sweepstakes for Earthlings. That matches the part where Matheny says they want to do a sweepstakes but can't because of Earth's laws. \n\nC. Earthlings not allowed to gamble on Mars. The story doesn't mention that. It's more about Martians trying to operate gambling on Earth. \n\nD. Martians not allowed to gamble on Earth. The story doesn't say that. The problem is Earth's laws preventing Mars from doing something, not Martians gambling on Earth. \n\nSo the correct answer is B.

The options are A to D.\n\nLooking back at the text, when Matheny wins the chips at the church, he buys them and then later when he's with Doran, he mentions that he didn't want to keep the chips because he was in a church. The church is a place of worship, and he felt out of place there. The story mentions that he was a Martian in a predominantly Earth environment, and the church setting made him feel uncomfortable. Also, when he was at the church, he was trying to find a place to sit, and the atmosphere was different from his usual environment. \n\nThe key part is when he says, \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\" and then Doran says he's not busy. Matheny then mentions that he was in a church, which is a place of worship, and he felt out of place. The chips were part of the game in the church, which he found odd. So the answer is likely A. He felt out of place. \n\nOption D says he didn't want to win money from a church, which is similar. But the text specifically mentions that he felt out of place in the church, which is why he didn't care about the chips. The answer is A.\n</think>\n\nA"

Peri is a character who is involved in some sort of con game. The story mentions that Gus Doran is trying to get Matheny to find a con man for Mars. Peri is involved in a situation where she's talking to Gus Doran on the phone. \n\nIn the text, Peri is trying to get out of a date with Sastro (the Martian) by saying she's going to dinner with someone else. She tells Gus that she's going to dinner with Sam Wendt instead. But Gus says he has a Martian for her, which is Badger. Then there's a part where Peri is talking to Gus, and he's trying to get her to break off the date with Sastro to go with Badger. \n\nBut the question is about how Peri helped con Matheny. Wait, Matheny is the Martian professor. The story's main plot is about Matheny trying to find a business manager for Mars. Peri is a character in the story, but the con involving Matheny is with Gus Doran. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is related to Peri's actions in the story. The question is about how Peri helped con Matheny. But in the story, Peri is the one who is involved in a con with Gus Doran. The con is that Gus is trying to get Matheny to find a con man. But Peri's role is in the initial part where she's trying to get out of a date with Sastro by going with Badger. \n\nBut the question is about how Peri helped con Matheny. Wait, maybe the answer is B: She went to dinner with him instead of Sastro. Because in the story, Peri is trying to get out of a date with Sastro by saying she's going to dinner with Sam Wendt. But Gus says he has a Martian for her. However, Peri is the one who is involved in the con with Gus, but the con is about getting Matheny to find a con man. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D: She got him drunk in the bar. But in the story, Peri isn't the one getting Matheny drunk. The part where Matheny gets drunk is with Gus Doran. \n\nWait, the question is about how Peri helped con Matheny. The answer might be B: She went to dinner with him instead of Sastro. Because in the story, Peri is the one who is trying to get out of the date with Sastro by saying she's going to dinner with Sam Wendt. But Gus is trying to get her to go with Badger. However, the con that Matheny is involved in is with Gus Doran, who is trying to get Matheny to find a con man. \n\nBut the question is about Peri helping con Matheny. Maybe the answer is B because Peri is the one who is involved in the con with Gus, and by going to dinner with Matheny instead of Sastro, she's helping to con him. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A: We never find out for sure. But the story does mention that Peri is involved in a con with Gus, but the main con is with Matheny. \n\nWait, the question is about how Peri helped con Matheny. The story says that Peri is trying to get out of a date with Sastro by going with Sam Wendt. But Gus is trying to get her to go with Badger. However, the con that Matheny is involved in is with Gus, who is trying to get Matheny to find a con man. \n\nI think the answer is B: She went to dinner with him instead of Sastro. Because in the story, Peri is the one who is trying to get out of the date with Sastro by going to dinner with someone else, which is Sam Wendt. But Gus is trying to get her to go with Badger. However, the con that Matheny is involved in is with Gus, so maybe Peri's action of going to dinner with Matheny (instead of Sastro) is part of the con. But the answer might be B.\n</think>\n\nB"

The options are A to D.\n\nLooking back at the text, Matheny enters the church after being told by Gus Doran to go there. He's in the church, and there's a mention of games like roulette and craps. He initially doesn't want to play bingo but considers roulette. He says, \"I'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\" Then he starts playing roulette, throws a row of sevens, and later plays craps. However, the question is about what he expected when he went in.\n\nThe text says he wanted to \"sit in\u2014\" so he was looking for a place to sit, not necessarily to gamble. But when he arrives, he's in a church with games. The key part is when he says, \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\" which indicates he intended to rest, not gamble. But the options don't have \"sit and rest\" as an option. Wait, option C is \"To sit for awhile and rest.\" So that's probably the answer. But let me check again.\n\nWait, the text says: \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\" so he was looking for a place to sit and rest. The church was a place to sit, but the games were there.

The story mentions that Mars is struggling economically. The protagonist, Peter Matheny, is a Martian who's trying to get a business manager for the export trade. He talks about the high costs of shipping goods from Mars to Earth, the lack of tourism, and the difficulty in competing with Earth's corporations. There's also mention of Mars being poor, with high taxes and middlemen taking most of the profit. \n\nThe story also highlights that Mars is trying to develop but is behind Earth in terms of economic systems. For example, Mars can't afford to send tourists because of the high costs, and their industries like thyle (a Martian drink) are expensive to produce and transport. The Red Ankh Society is mentioned as a large enterprise, but it's part of the problem because they're selling artifacts that are not really rare, but the middlemen take most of the money. \n\nSo, the answer should be about Mars being behind Earth in terms of socioeconomic status. The options are A: Behind the times, B: Earth trying to make a treaty, C: Same as Earth, D: Advanced. The story clearly shows Mars is struggling, so the correct answer is A.\n</think>\n\nA"

The options are A to D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points of their interaction. Peter is a Martian sent to Earth to find a business manager. He meets Gus Doran, an Earthman. Initially, Peter is skeptical about Gus's ability to help, but as they talk, Gus seems genuinely interested and helpful. \n\nIn the story, Peter is somewhat bewildered by Earth's complexities and Gus's ease in navigating them. Gus is friendly, offers help without expecting much, and even suggests a con man for Peter's mission. Peter starts to appreciate Gus's insight and willingness to assist, even though he's initially doubtful. \n\nLooking at the options, B says \"Skeptical, appreciative, friendly.\" That seems to fit. Peter is skeptical at first (due to the Martian's perspective on Earth's systems), but he becomes appreciative of Gus's help and friendly towards him. The other options don't capture the mix of skepticism and appreciation. So the answer is B.\n</think>\n\nB"

The story starts with Peri getting ready for dinner and then talking to Gus Doran. Later, Peter Matheny is introduced, and he's on Earth. There's a part where he's at a bar with Doran, and they talk about his job. Then they go to a hotel, and Matheny is given new clothes. The story ends with Doran saying he might find the con man and they plan a celebration.\n\nLooking at the timeline: The story starts with Peri's phone call, then moves to Matheny arriving on Earth, meeting Doran, their conversation, and then the end where they decide to look for the con man. The key point is that the story is told in a single day's timeline. There's no mention of weeks or months passing. The events happen in a single day, with Matheny arriving, spending the night, and the next day planning. So the answer is likely C. Less than a day.\n</think>\n\nC"

Then there's a part where Peri is talking about a Martian, and Gus is trying to get her to take his \"Martian\" for a date. Then later, there's a scene where Gus meets Peter Matheny, the Martian ambassador, and they talk about business. \n\nWait, Peri is a character who is involved in some sort of scheme with Gus. The story mentions that Gus is trying to get Peri to meet a Martian, but Peri is being cautious. Then, in the part where Gus is talking to Matheny, he's trying to find a con artist for Mars. \n\nBut the key point is that Peri and Gus are involved in a scheme. Peri is the one who is getting the call from Gus, and she's being set up with a Martian. But Gus is trying to get her to take his \"Martian\" instead. So they are working together in some sort of con or scheme. \n\nLooking at the options: C says they are conspiring con artists. That seems possible.

So maybe Gus is part of a con ring with Peri. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are old friends. But the text doesn't mention them being old friends. Peri is described as someone who is cautious and Gus is trying to get her into a scam. \n\nSo the answer is likely C: They are conspiring con artists.

The main character, Peter Matheny, is a Martian who's on Earth trying to find a business manager. The story mentions various aspects of Mars' economy and industries. \n\nIn the text, there's a conversation where Matheny talks about Mars' industries. For example, he mentions that Mars sells artifacts, which are expensive because of shipping and middlemen. There's also mention of thyle (a distilled spirit) that's sold on Earth, and that Mars has a problem with the high costs of shipping. Additionally, Matheny talks about postage stamps being a former mainstay but now overworked. They also mention color slides, postcards, and travel posters as things they sell to Earth. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Artifacts, Distilled spirits, Media\nB. Tourism, Collectibles, Distilled spirits\nC. Mining, Media, Artifacts\nD. Postage stamps, Mining, Tourism\n\nFrom the text, artifacts are mentioned as a major industry (selling old Martian relics). Distilled spirits (thyle) are discussed, though they're a problem because they're expensive to ship. Postage stamps are mentioned as a former mainstay. Collectibles might be part of artifacts. Tourism is not directly mentioned as an industry, but there's a mention of Mars being a destination for tourists, but the story doesn't say it's a major industry. Mining isn't explicitly mentioned, but the text talks about the need for Earth's equipment and supplies, which might imply mining. However, the story doesn't mention mining as an industry. \n\nWait, the story says that Mars has a problem with exporting because of high costs, but they do sell things like color slides, postcards, and travel posters. Also, the Red Ankh Society is mentioned as a big enterprise, which might be related to media or collectibles. \n\nLooking at the options again, the correct answer would include artifacts (as they are a major industry), distilled spirits (thyle), and media (like the travel posters and color slides). So option A: Artifacts, Distilled spirits, Media. \n\nAlternatively, postage stamps are mentioned, but the text says that they were a mainstay but now overworked. The answer might not include that. Also, tourism isn't explicitly stated as an industry. So A seems correct.\n</think>\n\nA"

The story mentions the Martian Embassy on Earth, which suggests that Mars has a diplomatic presence. There's a character named Peter Matheny who is a professor from Mars sent to Earth to handle business matters. The Martians talk about their economic challenges, like high costs of shipping goods to Earth and the difficulty of competing with Earth's corporations. They also mention the Red Ankh Society, which is part of their cultural or economic activities. \n\nThe story also references the United Protectorates, which seems to be a term used for a group of planets under a common governance structure. The Martians are part of this system, and they have a government that's trying to establish themselves economically. The Martians are described as having a small embassy and struggling with economic issues, which implies they have a government but are not a separate sovereign nation. They are part of a larger interplanetary system, possibly the United Protectorates, which is a separate entity from Earth. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA. Dictatorship \u2013 The story doesn't mention a dictatorship. The Martians seem to have a more bureaucratic or structured government, but not necessarily a dictatorship.\n\nB. Mars and Earth are the same \u2013 No, they are separate. The story shows them as different entities with different economic systems.\n\nC. Mars is forming a government \u2013 The story shows Mars has a government (embassy, economic policies) but it's not in the process of forming one. They're already established but struggling.\n\nD. A separate entity doing trade with Earth \u2013 This seems possible. The Martians are part of the United Protectorates, which is a separate entity, and they trade with Earth. The story mentions their economic challenges in trade, so they are a separate entity but part of a larger system. \n\nSo the correct answer is D. The story shows Mars as a separate entity (United Protectorates) that engages in trade with Earth, not a dictatorship or a merged government.\n</think>\n\nD"

The story is called \"Innocent at Large\" by Poul Anderson and Karen Anderson. From the text, there's a character named Peter Matheny from Mars who is sent to Earth to find a business manager. The story mentions that Mars is a colony, and there's some discussion about Mars being a colony of Earth. \n\nLooking at the context: The story mentions that Mars is a \"commercial empire\" and that Earth has a significant influence. There's a line where Matheny says, \"We are poor\u2014a handful of people trying to make a world of dust and sand...\" which suggests that Mars is a colony. Also, the story mentions that Earth has a large presence on Mars, with a embassy and people from Earth coming to Mars. \n\nThe options: \n\nA. Martians originated from another solar system and colonized Mars. The story doesn't mention anything about Martians coming from another solar system. The text refers to Martians as being from Mars, not originating elsewhere. \n\nB. Martians are uncertain of their origin because their artifacts were destroyed. The story does mention that Martians have artifacts, but there's no indication that they are uncertain of their origin. \n\nC. Martians evolved separately on Mars. This would mean they didn't come from Earth. However, the story seems to present Mars as a colony, with Earth having a significant role. \n\nD. Immigration from Earth. The story shows that Earth has a large influence on Mars, with Earth people coming to Mars, and Mars being a colony. The characters like Gus Doran are from Earth, and there's a mention of Earth's influence on Mars. \n\nSo, the correct answer is D. The story implies that Mars is colonized by Earth people, with Earth having a significant role in Mars' development. The Martians are the colonized people, not the original inhabitants.

He's sent by his government, so maybe not A.\n\nB. College professor on a personal mission to improve Mars' economy. That fits because he's there to find a business manager to help Mars' economy. He's a professor, and his mission is to improve Mars' economy through business opportunities.\n\nC. A con man pretending to recruit. But Peter is not a con man. He's looking for a real business manager, not a con artist. The con man is mentioned as someone else, like the slipstring.\n\nD. High official on Mars sent to Earth to gain info. But Peter is a professor, not a high official. He's a faculty member, not a high-ranking official.\n\nSo the correct answer is B. He's a college professor on a mission to improve Mars' economy by finding business opportunities.\n</think>\n\nB"
