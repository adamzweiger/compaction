He tries to move but is in a lot of pain and has broken bones.\n3. He crawls to a first-aid cabinet and uses a microswitch to activate it.\n4. After using the cabinet, he is mentioned to have his right leg numb, but reasonably comfortable, and clamped tight in a walking brace.\n\nFrom this information, it can be inferred that the first-aid cabinet helped Granthan with his injuries, including putting his leg in a walking brace.\n\n**A**"

However, he also learned how to duplicate the Gool's probe, which allowed him to reach out to the Gool's mind and access their thoughts.\n\nTherefore, he knew how to reach out to the Gool because he copied what they had done to him.\n\nC"

He gets out of the train at a siding in the swampy country outside New Orleans and walks to a black-top road.\n6. He gets into a car driven by a man who is thinking about shrimps and a girl with black hair.\n7. He gets out of the car on a street corner in a shabby marketing district of New Orleans.\n8.

The story begins with the protagonist, Granthan, waking up from a lifeboat after an attack by the Gool. He then receives a call from Colonel Kayle, which indicates that the war has been going on for some time.\n2. Granthan is told that he is the first recorded survivor of contact with the Gool, which suggests that the war has been ongoing for a significant period.\n3. The story jumps forward in time, and Granthan is in a lifeboat, trying to escape from the Earth's defenses. He is able to hack into the minds of others, including a radar operator and a general, which implies that he has been using his psychodynamic skills for some time.\n4. Granthan eventually escapes from the lifeboat and makes his way to the United States, where he takes on a new identity and begins to plan a raid on the Delta National Labs.\n5. The story jumps forward again, and Granthan is now in New Orleans, trying to get to the Delta National Labs.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that the passage of time is likely days or weeks, rather than months or hours. The protagonist is able to make significant progress in his plan, and he is able to use his skills to evade capture and manipulate others. This suggests that he has had time to recover from his injuries and plan his next move.\n\n**D**"

Peter was in a lifeboat, and Colonel Kayle ordered him to enter a parking orbit, implying that he was not allowed to return to Earth.\n2. Peter, however, managed to escape and was tracked by the DEW line patrol.\n3. The DEW line patrol initially cleared Peter to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere.\n4. However, shortly after, the clearance was countermanded, and Peter was ordered to change course.\n5. The reason for the countermanded clearance was not explicitly stated, but it suggests that someone higher up in the command chain realized that Peter was a threat and intervened.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely explanation is that the mistake was made by the operator of the security net around Earth, who initially cleared Peter to re-enter the atmosphere but then realized their mistake and countermanded the clearance.\n\n**D**"

He is found out by Colonel Kayle, who believes Peter has been controlled by the Gool and decides to kill him.\n4. Peter tries to reason with Kayle, but he is unsuccessful.\n5. Peter then decides to take matters into his own hands and infiltrate the military's radar system to prevent a missile attack.\n6. He successfully prevents the missile attack and escapes.\n7. Now, Peter is on Earth, and his goal is to share his knowledge with others to prevent the Gool's plan from being carried out.\n\nConsidering these steps, Peter's intention upon his return to Earth is to share his knowledge and prevent the Gool's plan from being carried out.\n\n**D**"

Peter is able to use this knowledge to his advantage, learning how to duplicate the Gool's telepathic probe and use it to manipulate the minds of others.\n\nGiven these points, it seems that Peter's telepathic abilities are a result of his training and experience as a psychodynamicist, rather than a natural ability he has had since childhood.\n\n**A**"
