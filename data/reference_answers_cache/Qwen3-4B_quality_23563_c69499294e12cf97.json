Then there's Contarini, his companion. Later, there's a part where Mr. Jasperson is talking on the phone. The key part is when Jasperson mentions seeing a big, bearded man with a monk's robe made of gunny sack. \n\nWait, when Broom is in the strange building, he's in a different time, like the Middle Ages. Then, in the present day, Mr. Jasperson is the one who calls the police about the man he saw.

So, they are the same person, but in different times. But the question is about their relationship. \n\nWait, the answer is that they are strangers.

But the story says that when Broom returns, he's Richard Broom, the king, and Jasperson is a man in the present who saw him. So they are not related. Therefore, the answer is C. They are strangers.

But it's a painting, not a photograph. The key point here is that the painting's clarity was due to the fact that Broom's own memory was fuzzy, making the painting seem more real than it was. Wait, in the story, Broom had lost his memory and was disoriented. When he saw the painting, he thought it was a mirror because of his confusion. So the answer would be B: Broom's fuzziness made it look clearer than it was. Because his memory was unclear, the painting's details seemed more vivid to him.

The streets below had been filled with moving vehicles of some kind, but it had been difficult to tell whether there had been anyone walking down there from this height.\" \n\nThen, when he's in the room with the doors, he says, \"He had the uneasy feeling that hidden, unseen eyes were watching his every move, and yet he could detect nothing. There was no sound except the faint humming from the device in the room behind him, and a deeper, almost inaudible, rushing, rumbling sound that seemed to come from far below.\" \n\nHe's worried about being watched, so he's thinking about having a weapon. The text specifically mentions, \"He wondered what sort of men lived in this fantastic city. So far, he had seen no one. The streets below had been filled with moving vehicles of some kind, but it had been difficult to tell whether there had been anyone walking down there from this height.\" \n\nBut the key line is when he's in the room and says, \"He had no chance of that, of course.

The text says, \"He wondered what sort of men lived in this fantastic city. So far, he had seen no one. The streets below had been filled with moving vehicles of some kind, but it had been difficult to tell whether there had been anyone walking down there from this height.\" \n\nWait, actually, the exact line is: \"He wondered what sort of men lived in this fantastic city. So far, he had seen no one. The streets below had been filled with moving vehicles of some kind, but it had been difficult to tell whether there had been anyone walking down there from this height.\" \n\nBut the part where he's thinking about a weapon is when he's in the room with the doors.

The streets below had been filled with moving vehicles of some kind, but it had been difficult to tell whether there had been anyone walking down there from this height.\" \n\nWait, no. Let me check again. The text says: \"He wondered what sort of men lived in this fantastic city. So far, he had seen no one. The streets below had been filled with moving vehicles of some kind, but it had been difficult to tell whether there had been anyone walking down there from this height.\" \n\nThen, later, when he's in the room, he says: \"He had the uneasy feeling that hidden, unseen eyes were watching his every move, and yet he could detect nothing.

It was an accident.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the story. The story is about Broom waking up in an unfamiliar place, and he meets Contarini. Contarini mentions something about time being like a river and that he tried to think about it to escape but couldn't. Broom later remembers that Contarini told him about time travel, but the method isn't explicitly stated as thinking. However, Contarini's dialogue suggests that he tried to use his mind to escape, but failed. Broom himself tries to use that method later. \n\nBut the actual mechanism of how he traveled through time isn't clearly explained. The story doesn't say it was an accident, nor does it state that Contarini sent him. The answer might be A, but the story doesn't explicitly say he traveled by thinking. Alternatively, maybe it's B, since the text doesn't give a clear explanation. Wait, but Contarini's conversation with Broom implies that Broom was sent there by Contarini's attempt to escape. Wait, no, Contarini says he tried but couldn't. Broom was sent there through time travel, but the method isn't clear. The story doesn't specify how he got there. However, the question is about how he traveled through time. The answer might be A, as Contarini says that thinking about time can let you escape, and Broom tried that. But the story doesn't explicitly say that Broom traveled by thinking. Alternatively, maybe it's D, an accident. But the story doesn't mention an accident. The correct answer is probably A, as Contarini's dialogue suggests that thinking about time is the method. But the story doesn't explicitly state that Broom traveled by thinking. Wait, the story says that Contarini told Broom that he tried to think about time to escape, but couldn't. Then Broom later tries to use that method. However, the actual time travel is explained as being in a time machine, but the story doesn't mention that. Wait, the story mentions that Broom was in a room with a machine, but it's not clear if that's the method. The answer might be A, but the story doesn't explicitly say that. Alternatively, the answer is B, since the text doesn't explain how he traveled. But the question is from the story, so maybe the answer is A. However, the story says that Contarini tried to think about it, but Broom was sent there through time travel. The answer is A because Contarini says that thinking about time can let you escape, and Broom tried that. But the story doesn't explicitly say that Broom traveled by thinking. Hmm. The correct answer is A, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, the answer is B because the text doesn't explain how he traveled. But the story does mention that Contarini tried to use his mind, and Broom tried that. So the answer is A.\n</think>\n\nA"

The office.\n\nI need to recall the story. There's a part where Broom is in a strange place and he's worried about being trapped. He thinks, \"Better the devil we know than the devil we don't.\" The phrase \"devil we know\" refers to something he's familiar with, whereas \"devil we don't\" is unknown. \n\nIn the context, the door behind him was pressing against his hand, wanting to close. He was considering whether to leave it open or not. The phrase \"Better the devil we know than the devil we don't\" is a common saying meaning it's better to face a known danger than an unknown one. So the \"devil Broom knows\" would be the door, which he's familiar with, versus the unknown dangers outside. But the options don't have \"door\" as an answer. Wait, the options are A. Outside, B.

Wait, the line is in the context where he's in the room, and the door is the one he's considering. The \"devil we know\" is the door, which is in the room. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, the answer might be B. The past, but that's not directly related. Wait, the question is about what is referenced as the devil Broom knows.

Unknown language from the past, D. English.\n\nFirst, I need to find where Mr. Edward Jasperson is mentioned in the text. The story is about Richard Broom, who is a king in the past, and then there's a part where he's in a strange place. Then, there's a part where the story switches to someone else, Mr. Edward Jasperson, who is speaking on the phone.\n\nLooking at the text, the part with Mr. Jasperson is towards the end.

The question is about the language he's using. The story is set in a time travel context, where Richard Broom is a king from the past (Plantagenet), and the story is told in the present (1960s, as per the etext note). \n\nBut the question is about the language Mr. Jasperson is speaking. The text says he's speaking \"hurriedly into the telephone,\" and the previous part mentions that Richard Broom is speaking to Contarini in Italian.

The context of the story seems to involve a time travel element, but the reason for being a prisoner is tied to a past event. The story also references a war, as Broom had faced death during the war. \n\nThe answer options: The story doesn't explicitly state the reason for his imprisonment, but the mention of war and the context of being a prisoner in a dungeon points towards war as the reason.
