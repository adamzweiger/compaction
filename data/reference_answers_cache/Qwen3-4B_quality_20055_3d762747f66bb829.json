The options are A to D.\n\nLooking back at the provided text, the first paragraph says: \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises. Then she explains that civility is like a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations.\" But her book is about other books on civility and spreads their insights. So she's not writing a book that's about civility itself, but rather about other books that discuss civility. \n\nThe question is why she says her book isn't about civility. The answer would be because she's not focusing on civility as a topic but rather on analyzing other works about it. The options given are about her views on civility. The correct answer would be C: She thinks civility is too superficial of a solution. Wait, but the text says she's not writing a book about civility but about other books on civility. However, the options don't mention that. The options are about her beliefs. The first paragraph says she's not writing another book about civility, but rather a book about other books on civility. So the reason she says her book isn't about civility is because she's not focusing on civility itself but on other books about it. But the options don't have that. The options are about her beliefs regarding civility. The text says she thinks civility is a veneer, which is superficial. So maybe C is correct. The answer is C.\n</think>\n\nC"

The options are A to D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the text. The user provided a detailed review of Deborah Tannen's book \"The Argument Culture.\" The author of the review criticizes Tannen for conflating different concepts. \n\nLooking back at the text, there's a part where the author says: \"Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle.\" The author then contrasts personal relationships (snuggle) with public or political struggles. \n\nBut the question is about what two fields Tannen mixes. The answer might be related to the spheres of personal and public communication. The text mentions that Tannen applies her precepts to national conversation but gets confused, mixing personal and public aspects. \n\nIn the text, the author also talks about Tannen conflating belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, etc., which are public issues, with personal issues like family dynamics. So the author is saying Tannen mixes personal (snuggle) and public (struggle) communication. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is \"personal communication and public communication.\" That seems to fit. The answer is C.\n</think>\n\nC"

The options are A through D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points from the text. The author criticizes Tannen for conflating different concepts like belligerence and incivility, and for blaming various factors for societal issues. Also, the author points out that Tannen's approach is paternalistic, trying to filter out strife and debate. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA. Supporting Bill Clinton. The text mentions Tannen's criticism of certain political figures and her stance on some issues, but the author doesn't explicitly say she's supporting Clinton. The author criticizes Tannen for dismissing criticism of leaders, but that's more about her stance on criticism rather than supporting Clinton specifically. So maybe not A.\n\nB. Thinking she can apply linguistics to intergender communication. The text says Tannen previously focused on intergender communication, but the author doesn't say that's contradictory. The problem is more about her applying that to national issues, not the original work. So maybe not B.\n\nC. Being against email and mass communication while using it herself. The text mentions Tannen's criticism of email and mass communication, but does she use it herself? The author says she's against it but maybe uses it in her work. Wait, the text says she's against email because it makes it easy to forward messages, but the author doesn't mention her using it. However, the text says she's against it but perhaps she's using it in her writing. But the question is about contradiction. The author might be pointing out that Tannen criticizes mass communication but uses it in her own work. However, the text doesn't explicitly say she uses it. Maybe not C.\n\nD. Saying not to criticize others while criticizing people herself. The author points out that Tannen dismisses criticism of leaders as apologetics, even when she herself is criticizing them. For example, she criticizes Clinton's handling of issues but says that criticizing him is an apology. So she's telling others not to criticize but doing it herself. That's a contradiction. So D seems correct.\n\nSo the answer is D.\n</think>\n\nD"

The review starts by saying that Tannen's book is \"the whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious.\" That sounds negative. Then the author points out that Tannen conflates various issues and makes some mistakes, like blaming technology for problems and not distinguishing between different social spheres. \n\nThe author also criticizes Tannen's approach to specific examples, like blaming the media for Princess Diana's death and comparing journalism to totalitarian propaganda. There's a lot of criticism here. However, the author does acknowledge some sage advice in the book, like listening and not arguing for arguing's sake. But the overall tone seems to be that the book has some good points but is flawed.\n\nLooking at the options, the author isn't saying nothing is worthwhile (so not A), not that it's the best (D is out), and not that it's very worthwhile (B is out).

The author is reviewing Deborah Tannen's \"The Argument Culture.\" The key here is to look at what the author says is the book's advice versus what the author criticizes.\n\nThe original text mentions that Tannen's book provides certain lessons like listening, not nit-picking, not arguing for argument's sake, focusing on substance, not fighting small issues, etc. The author then points out that Tannen conflates various negative aspects and makes some mistakes in her analysis.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Look on all sides of a discussion \u2013 This is mentioned in the text as \"Many issues are multisided.\" So that's a lesson from the book. So A is a lesson the author gleaned, so not the answer.\n\nB. Extremists are usually the most courageous people \u2013 The text doesn't mention anything about extremists being courageous. In fact, the author criticizes Tannen for conflating different issues and making simplistic judgments. The book's advice is more about not being extreme, not about praising extremists. So B might not be a lesson from the book. But need to check others.\n\nC. Innovating is better than criticizing \u2013 The text doesn't mention anything about innovation versus criticism. The author's critique is about Tannen's approach, not about innovation. So maybe C is not a lesson from the book.\n\nD. Don't misrepresent things or people will stop listening to you \u2013 The text says Tannen \"seizes upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" So this is similar to misrepresenting. The author is saying that Tannen does this, which would mean that the lesson is not to misrepresent. So D is a lesson from the book, so not the answer.\n\nSo the question is between B and C. The author's review points out that Tannen's advice is to not argue for argument's sake, not to nit-pick, etc. The options given are about what the author gleaned from the book. The author says that Tannen's book has lessons like \"Don't just quarrel; listen and learn.\" So the author is saying that Tannen's book has those lessons. But the question is which is NOT a lesson the author gleaned from the book.\n\nThe options are about what the author thinks is a lesson from the book. The author's own review says that Tannen's book gives those lessons. So the answer would be the one that's not in the book's lessons. The author says that Tannen's lessons include looking at both sides (A), not misrepresenting (D), and not arguing for argument's sake. The book's lessons don't mention anything about extremists being courageous (B) or innovating vs. criticizing (C). The text doesn't mention innovation. So the answer is either B or C. The text says that Tannen's advice is to not argue for argument's sake, not to focus on personal flaws, etc. So the author's own take is that the book's lessons are about not being extreme, not misrepresenting, etc. The option B is not mentioned. The answer is B or C. The original text says that Tannen's book advises to not argue for argument's sake, to focus on substance, not small issues, etc. So the author's own gleaned lessons from the book would include A and D. The option C is \"Innovating is better than criticizing.\" The book's advice is about not arguing, not nit-picking, but not about innovation. So C is not a lesson from the book. But the question is which is NOT a lesson the author gleaned from the book. The author's review says that the book's lessons are the ones listed, so the answer is B or C. The text doesn't mention anything about extremists being courageous, so B is not a lesson. The answer is B. But wait, the question is what is NOT a lesson the author gleaned from the book. The author's review says that the book's lessons are the ones listed. So the answer is B, because the book doesn't say that. The author says that Tannen's book advises to not argue for argument's sake, but not that extremists are courageous. So B is not a lesson from the book. Therefore, the answer is B.\n</think>\n\nB"

The author is critical of Tannen's book, The Argument Culture. The author points out that Tannen conflates different concepts like belligerence, divisiveness, and other negative traits, and blames various factors for societal issues. The author also criticizes Tannen for not distinguishing between different social spheres, like the sphere of snuggle (personal relationships) versus the sphere of struggle (like dealing with enemies or terrorists). \n\nThe author argues that Tannen's approach is too simplistic and paternalistic, trying to filter out strife and debate. The author also points out that Tannen's comparisons to authoritarian regimes are flawed and that she doesn't properly address the need for critical discourse, especially in areas like law and journalism where confrontation is necessary.\n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA. She believes people should be critical of everything they disagree with, no matter how small. The author seems to criticize Tannen for being too lenient, but this option is about the author's view. Wait, the question is why the author thinks Tannen is wrong. The author is criticizing Tannen for not distinguishing between different social contexts, like treating terrorists the same as friends. \n\nD. She advocates treating a terrorist the same way you treat your best friend. The author mentions that Tannen confuses the sphere of snuggle (personal relationships) with the sphere of struggle (like dealing with enemies). The author argues that Tannen's approach is wrong because you shouldn't treat a terrorist the same way you treat a friend. \n\nSo the correct answer would be D.

Tannen blames the mainstream press for things like torturing Princess Diana and driving someone to suicide. But the author seems to be arguing against Tannen's criticisms. \n\nIn the part where the author talks about the press, they mention that the Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press's scrutiny of powerful people \"safeguard the country.\" That suggests the author thinks investigative journalism is good because it holds people accountable. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that Tannen doesn't trust the media, but the author is defending the media's role. The author says that the press's scrutiny of powerful people is necessary. So the author probably thinks investigative journalism helps stop people from abusing power. That would be option C. \n\nThe other options: A is about driving people to suicide, which Tannen says, but the author is against that. B is nothing, which doesn't fit.

The options are A to D.\n\nLooking back at the provided text, there's a section where Tannen compares Vietnam to World War II. She mentions that in WWII, soldiers trained, served, and went home together, but in Vietnam, it was a \"lonely war\" with shifting units. Then she says she ignores the more important difference: in WWII they were fighting Hitler. \n\nSo, the mistake here is that she's equating the two conflicts, but the key difference is the enemy. She's not considering that the nature of the enemy (Hitler vs. the Vietcong) is different. But the options don't have \"equating different enemies.\" Wait, the options are A. seeing the world as too dangerous, B. oversimplification, C. equating police and military, D. denying the holocaust.\n\nWait, the text also talks about Tannen's criticism of the military and how she's not considering the difference between the spheres of snuggle and struggle. But in the military context, she's comparing Vietnam to WWII, but she ignores the key difference that in WWII they were fighting a specific enemy (Hitler) whereas in Vietnam, it was a different context. However, the options don't directly mention that. \n\nLooking at the options again, the answer might be B. oversimplification. Because she's oversimplifying the differences between the two wars. She's taking a complex situation (Vietnam) and simplifying it by comparing it to WWII, but not considering the actual differences. Alternatively, maybe C is equating police and military, but that's not mentioned here. The text says she's comparing the military's experience in Vietnam to WWII, but she's not equating police and military. \n\nWait, the text says she \"ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler.\" So she's not considering that the enemy was different, which is a form of oversimplification. Therefore, the answer is B. oversimplification. But let me check the options again. The options are A, B, C, D. The correct answer is B. Oversimplification.

See no evil, C. Speak no evil, D. Do no evil.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Tannen's main arguments are in the text. The review talks about her book \"The Argument Culture\" where she criticizes the rise of belligerence in various areas. She wants to promote mutual understanding and avoid conflict. However, the reviewer points out that Tannen conflates different forms of conflict and maybe oversimplifies issues. \n\nThe key points from the text include her advocating for listening, not nit-picking, not arguing for argument's sake, focusing on substance, and avoiding small issues. She also criticizes the media and political figures, suggesting that some conflicts are necessary. However, she seems to want to filter out strife, deception, and debate, which might align with the idea of not engaging in evil actions or not participating in harmful arguments.\n\nLooking at the options, \"Hear no evil\" (A) is about not hearing negative things, \"See no evil\" (B) is about not seeing negative things, \"Speak no evil\" (C) is about not speaking negatively, and \"Do no evil\" (D) is about not doing harmful things. \n\nTannen's approach seems to be about avoiding conflict and not engaging in arguments that are harmful. She wants to filter out strife, so maybe she's in favor of not participating in evil (D). But the options are a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, since she wants to avoid contentious public discourse, maybe \"Speak no evil\" (C) because she's against criticizing others. However, the text mentions she criticizes certain actions, so maybe not. \n\nWait, the text says she wants to \"cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate.\" That sounds like not hearing or engaging in evil. But the options are about the four virtues. The original question is which statement resonates with her viewpoint. The answer might be A, B, or C. However, the text mentions she wants to avoid conflict, so maybe \"Hear no evil\" (A) is about not hearing negative things, but the text says she wants to avoid conflict, which could be seen as not engaging in evil. Alternatively, \"Do no evil\" (D) is about not doing harmful things. \n\nBut the text also mentions that she wants to avoid certain forms of criticism, like the media's treatment of leaders. So maybe she's in favor of not speaking evil (C). However, the text says she's against the media's harsh criticism, so maybe she's in favor of not speaking evil. But the answer might be A, B, or D. \n\nAlternatively, the text says she wants to filter out strife, which could be \"Hear no evil\" (A) or \"See no evil\" (B). But the question is which statement resonates with her viewpoint. The answer is likely A, B, or C. However, the text says she wants to avoid conflict, so maybe \"Speak no evil\" (C) is about not speaking against others. But the text also says she criticizes certain actions, so maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is A. Hear no evil, which is about not hearing negative things, which aligns with her desire to filter out strife and deception. But I'm a bit confused. The correct answer is probably A, B, or C. Wait, the text says she wants to avoid conflict, so maybe \"Speak no evil\" (C) is the answer. But I'm not sure. The text says she wants to avoid arguments, so maybe \"Speak no evil\" (C) is about not speaking against others. Alternatively, \"Do no evil\" (D) is about not doing harmful things. \n\nBut the text says she's against the media's harsh criticism, so she might support \"Speak no evil\" (C). However, the answer might be A. Hear no evil. The text says she wants to filter out strife, which is about not hearing evil. But I'm not certain. The correct answer is likely A, B, or C. However, the original text says she wants to avoid conflict, so \"Speak no evil\" (C) might be the answer. But I think the answer is A. Hear no evil. Because she wants to avoid hearing negative things, like the \"argument culture\" and the \"scandal\" stuff. So maybe A.\n</think>\n\nA"

She mentions that the First Amendment has become a \"pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" That suggests she's critical of how the First Amendment is being used, maybe not fully supporting it. \n\nShe also proposes alternatives, like Asian authoritarianism, and suggests Japanese systems where there's less debate. She seems to prefer a more controlled environment, which might align with opposing the Bill of Rights as it's currently structured. \n\nIn the text, she argues against cross-examinations in court, which is part of the adversarial system, and suggests other systems like France's where the judge does most of the questioning. This indicates she's not in favor of the American system, which includes the Bill of Rights protections. \n\nSo, she doesn't support the Bill of Rights fully (A is out). She doesn't think people use it responsibly (B is out).

It also says she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns into a self-help movement.

The book \"The Argument Culture\" is about public discourse and how to improve communication, which seems to be based on sociological or psychological studies of human interaction.\n\nThe text also references her previous books, which were about gender communication.

It says, \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" Also, she mentions that email makes it easy to forward messages, reply before cooling down, and broadcast without thinking about how each sentence strikes recipients. \n\nAdditionally, she criticizes the use of technology in spreading misinformation, like how she blames communications technology for obscene calls. She also mentions that technology allows for quick dissemination of messages, which can lead to misunderstandings or conflicts. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA.

Then the author points out that Tannen conflates various negative traits like belligerence, divisiveness, etc., and blames many things for the issues. The author also mentions that Tannen makes mistakes in distinguishing between different social spheres, like snuggle vs. struggle. \n\nLooking at the options: A says it's partisan. The author does criticize Tannen's views on certain political issues, like her stance on Clinton and others, but does that make the book partisan? Maybe, but the main criticism seems to be more about her oversimplification and conflating different issues.\n\nOption D says it oversimplifies. The passage says Tannen \"succumbs to these temptations\" of oversimplifying. The author also mentions that she makes culprits out of various things and conflates different concepts.

The author starts by saying that Tannen's book is about other books on civility, but the author thinks it's less perceptive. Then, the author acknowledges some good advice from Tannen, like listening, not nit-picking, focusing on substance, etc. But when applying these to the national level, the author criticizes Tannen for conflating different issues and not distinguishing between different social spheres (snuggle vs. struggle). The author also points out that Tannen's approach is too paternalistic, filtering out strife and debate, and maybe even being biased towards certain political views.\n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA says the author recognizes some good advice but says they don't extend to the nation. That seems possible because the author does mention the sage advice but then criticizes her application to the national context.\n\nB says no positive aspects are recognized.

The author does criticize how Tannen applies the advice, but does the author agree with the premises? The author seems to agree that the advice is good but thinks Tannen misapplies it. However, the author also points out that Tannen's approach is flawed in some ways, like conflating different issues. So maybe C is not exactly right.\n\nD says the author acknowledges Tannen's background and balances the criticism through that understanding. The author does mention that Tannen comes from a background in intergender communication and couples counseling, and then criticizes her application to the national level. The author seems to balance by pointing out her limitations in applying the advice to broader societal issues. So maybe D is correct.\n\nBut wait, the author does acknowledge the good advice (so some positive aspects) but then criticizes her application. So A says the author recognizes some good advice but says they don't extend to the nation. That's exactly what the author does. The author says the advice is sage but when applied to the nation, Tannen gets confused. So A is correct.\n\nBut the author also mentions that Tannen's approach is too paternalistic and conflates different issues, which is a criticism.

The passage mentions that Tannen criticizes cross-examinations, arguing that their purpose isn't to establish facts but to discredit witnesses.

So maybe she thinks that personal credibility (the witness's credibility) is more important than facts. But the text says that cross-examination is supposed to establish facts, but she argues that it's not. So maybe she thinks that the system is more about discrediting, not facts. Therefore, A says personal credibility is more important than facts. But the text says that cross-examination is not about facts but discrediting. So perhaps she thinks that the system is focused on discrediting, which is about credibility, not facts.
