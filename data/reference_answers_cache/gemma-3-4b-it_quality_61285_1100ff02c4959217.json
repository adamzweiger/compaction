He\u2019s prone to impulsive reactions and blunt statements.\n5. **Retief\u2019s Patience:** Retief appears to be more composed and strategic, attempting to manage Georges\u2019 outbursts and maintain a professional facade.\n6. **Mutual Respect (Subtle):** Despite their disagreements, there\u2019s a clear understanding and a willingness to work together. Retief consistently includes Georges, even when he\u2019s exasperated.\n\nConsidering these points, none of the options perfectly fit. However, \u201cB. Argumentative diplomatic colleagues\u201d captures the dynamic of their interactions most accurately \u2013 they are clearly working together professionally, but their approaches and opinions often clash, leading to arguments.\n\nB"

This indicates a past collaboration or at least a shared history.\n2. **Current Conflict:** The conflict is described as a \u201cnice hot little shooting war\u201d brewing over land grabbing. This signifies an ongoing dispute, not a long-standing, ancient rivalry.\n3. **Boyar Actions:** The Boyars have spent 60 years terraforming Flamme and have established a presence. They are \u201cnaive\u201d and rely on the Corps for support, which is now being withdrawn.\n4. **Aga Kagan Actions:** The Aga Kagans are aggressively expanding their territory, landing \u201cdetachments\u201d and \u201cparties\u201d and claiming land that the Boyars have already invested in.\n\nBased on these points, the relationship is not one of millennia-long war, nor is it a brand-new conflict. It\u2019s a current dispute stemming from a past agreement and a shift in Corps policy.\n\nD"

The story explicitly states they\u2019ve been terraforming the planet for \u201csixty years.\u201d That\u2019s a significant period of time, but it\u2019s worth considering if there\u2019s any hint of a longer initial period.\n\nThe text mentions that sixty years ago, the Corps was *encouraging* the Boyars to settle. This implies they weren't the first to arrive, but rather a group that was actively supported. However, the core narrative focuses on the sixty years *since* that initial encouragement.\n\nGiven this context, sixty years represents a substantial investment and transformation of the planet. While it could be longer, it\u2019s the most direct and emphasized timeframe.\n\nD"

This suggests an initial supportive stance.\n\n2. **Later Response:** However, when the Aga Kagans began encroaching on Boyar territory, the Corp\u2019s reaction was remarkably passive. They didn\u2019t take immediate action, relying on diplomatic maneuvering and a \u201cNote.\u201d\n\n3. **Under-Secretary\u2019s Behavior:** The Under-Secretary repeatedly urges Retief to \u201cstring them along\u201d and acknowledges the systemic issues with reporting and fiscal years, highlighting a prioritization of bureaucratic procedures over decisive action.\n\n4. **Lack of Concrete Support:** Ultimately, the Corp offers only a \u201cNote,\u201d a symbolic gesture with no actual enforcement power.\n\nConsidering these points, \u201cerratic\u201d seems the most fitting descriptor. Their initial encouragement contrasts sharply with their subsequent inaction, suggesting a lack of consistent or predictable governance. \u201cAggressive\u201d is incorrect as they avoided conflict. \u201cBureaucratic\u201d is partially true, but it doesn't fully capture the element of inaction and the disregard for the Boyars\u2019 situation. \"Efficient\" is the opposite of what the text portrays.\n\nD"
