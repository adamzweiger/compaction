The selection of these passages was done by Mal, not Peggy, Amy, or Randy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC"

A newspaper director hires a young reporter who is the best they have ever seen:** The text mentions Peggy's father owns a newspaper and she has worked there, but it doesn't frame the story around a hiring scenario or a \"best reporter\" narrative.\n*   **B. Unknown:** We have a decent amount of information, so \"unknown\" isn't accurate.\n*   **C. The male lead tries to gain the love of a career woman:** The text describes casting calls for a play. Peggy hopes for a role, and there's a mention of a leading man character, but it doesn't suggest a central plot about winning someone\u2019s love.\n*   **D. A career woman takes others under her wing to learn the ropes of the printing industry:** Again, the focus is on acting and a play, not the printing industry.\n\nWhile we don't have a complete summary of the play's plot, the text centers on the casting process for a new play titled \"Come Closer,\" revealing the struggles and hopes of aspiring actresses. It doesn\u2019t give clear evidence for options A, C, or D.\n\nB"

This is incorrect.\n   * **B:** While comedic talent is mentioned, it's not presented as a primary concern or a high priority in their initial casting process.\n   * **C:** This aligns directly with the passage's description of the first cast call \u2013 selecting based on appearance.\n   * **D:** The passage doesn't mention assigning roles based on personality after a shared reading.\n\nTherefore, the story teaches that the look of the person is most important before acting ability.\n\nC"

This implies a specific look is desired, not just a general \"good look.\"\n*   **Amy's Situation:** Amy is told she's \"too pretty\" for the roles available, highlighting how looks can be a barrier.\n*   **Mal and Randy's Comments:** Mal and Randy are described as looking over actors and murmuring notes to Amy, which suggests assessing physical suitability. They eliminate actresses based on hair color, height, or general type. Mr. Lang's rejection is rooted in his appearance not fitting the desired \"bluff-looking\" businessman.\n*   **Friendship vs. Honesty:** While there's supportive banter between friends (like Peggy and Amy, and Peggy and Paula), it\u2019s interspersed with honest assessments of how appearances fit (or don\u2019t fit) the roles. Peggy cautions Paula not to \"count too much\" on getting the part, even while complimenting her looks.\n*   **Livestock Show Analogy:** Peggy compares the casting process to a livestock show, underlining the superficial assessment of individuals based on physical attributes.\n\nBased on this, the most accurate description is that people are being honest about looks, acknowledging that physical appearance is important, and the play demands specific types.\n\nC"

They still *want* the roles.\n*   **B:** There's a sense of optimism and resilience, suggesting they believe in their abilities and future opportunities. This is a contributing factor but not the main driver of their support.\n*   **C:** This is incorrect. Peggy and Paula are both vying for the female lead, and Greta is also auditioning. Competition *is* present.\n*   **D:** They've only just met, so a long-standing friendship isn't the basis for their support.\n\nThe shared experience of auditioning, the understanding of the competitive environment, and a general sense of camaraderie among actresses seeking similar opportunities contribute to their support. Option B comes closest to encapsulating this, but it\u2019s the understanding and shared struggle that fosters the support, rather than a belief in future success alone. The shared experience is more central than future prospects.\n\nB"

She would visit home in four months:** The text doesn't mention anything about a four-month timeframe or a planned visit home.\n* **B. She'd probably be happy for a short bit, but then stressed that it wouldn't be enough to prove herself to her parents:** This aligns strongly with the text. Peggy's primary motivation for getting the role is to convince her parents she can earn a living as an actress. She's in her \"trial year\" and needs to demonstrate success. The text indicates she's worried about this and will need to show her parents she can earn money.\n* **C. She wouldn't go home in four months:** While possible, it's not directly supported by the text.\n* **D. She would feel like she'd completely earned it without any favoritism:** The text explicitly states Peggy worries about favoritism due to her friendship with Randy and Mal and that she'll \"really have to work for it.\" It\u2019s unlikely she'd feel she earned it without facing that concern.\n\nTherefore, the most probable outcome is that Peggy would initially be happy but quickly feel pressure to prove her success to her parents.\n\nB"

She'd find another role quickly because she has good connections and networking skills.** While Peggy has connections (Mal and Randy), the text highlights the competitive and often discouraging nature of auditions. It's unlikely she'd find another role *quickly* just based on those connections.\n*   **B. She'd try to secure a role within four months.** The text doesn't specify a timeframe for finding another role.\n*   **C. A new role wouldn't be guaranteed, but she'd convince Randy to write her into a future play.** This is the strongest possibility. The text explicitly states Peggy's familiarity with the play and hints at a special connection with Randy (even suggesting he might have written the part for her). She feels like she understands the play well, and that understanding, combined with her relationship with Randy, makes this a plausible outcome.\n*   **D. She'd get the approval from her parents to stay for an extra year; they want the best for her and believe in her skills.** Peggy\u2019s parents have a year-long trial period contingent on showing \u201csigns of success.\u201d Failing to get this role suggests she *won't* demonstrate that success, and the text implies they'll want her to return home and go to college.\n\nD\n\n\n\nC"

They are vying for the same opportunities, but also offer each other support.\n*   **Caring:** They express sympathy for each other\u2019s anxieties and offer encouragement. Peggy, in particular, is supportive of Paula.\n*   **Beautiful:** The text repeatedly mentions their attractiveness, especially Paula being described as \"striking\" and \"beautiful,\" and Amy noting Peggy\u2019s versatile looks. Greta\u2019s appearance is also described positively.\n*   **Insecure/Anxious:** All three women display nervousness and self-doubt about their acting abilities and chances of getting roles.\n*   **Tough/Jaded:** While Greta has experienced a setback, and Amy makes cynical remarks, none of them seem fundamentally tough or jaded.\n*   **Kind/Non-competitive:** Their interactions show kindness and a degree of supportive camaraderie, although a competitive undercurrent exists.\n\nConsidering all of these aspects, option A seems the most accurate.\n\nA"

Mal told her she didn't \"look or sound right\" for any part, suggesting different roles were in mind.\n\nC. This is also incorrect for the same reason as B. Amy and Paula hadn't known each other well enough for that to be a consideration yet.\n\nD. While a supportive friend might want the play to succeed, this isn\u2019t the *primary* reason for Amy's absence from the audition. Her role as secretary seems more connected to her existing relationship with Randy and Mal.\n\nTherefore, option A seems to be the most fitting narrative purpose.\n\nA"

A grandmother might find some connection, but it's not the primary draw.\n*   **B. Someone who likes theater and enjoys thinking about the audition process and seeing it play out:** This is the strongest contender. The excerpt *is* about the audition process, detailing the anxieties, the judgments, the different personalities, and the behind-the-scenes atmosphere. It delves into the nuances of casting and the actors\u2019 perspectives.\n*   **C. A male actor trying to see what the audition process feels like to actresses during their auditions:** While the excerpt offers some insight, it's primarily centered on the actresses' experiences and camaraderie. The male actors are observed, not deeply explored.\n*   **D. A young child who dreams to be an actress and primarily wants to hear success stories:** The excerpt is quite realistic and emphasizes the uncertainty and anxieties of auditions.
