The first time, Potter says, \"You must be Lemuel's cousin.\" Retief replies, \"I'm glad you're a poor shot. That missile was too close for comfort.\" - He doesn't explicitly deny being Lemuel's cousin, but changes the subject.\n2. Potter says, \"Hey, you must be Lemuel's cousin.\" Retief replies, \"I'm\u2014\" but gets interrupted.\n3. Potter says, \u201cHe ain\u2019t no cousin of mine,\u201d Lemuel says slowly.\n\nTherefore, Retief attempts to state he is *not* Lemuel's cousin twice.\n\nD"

He thought they looked like blankets:** The text states, \"He figured it was a Flap-jack boat; looks just like 'em. I took a shot when I saw something move.\" This supports the idea that he associates the Flap-jacks with a specific appearance.\n*   **B. He thought they wanted to take over the oases:** The text mentions a desire to hang onto their farms, but doesn't suggest Potter thought the Flap-jacks *wanted* the oases.\n*   **C. He thought they killed some men:** The text states, \"We've lost four men now and a dozen more in the freezer...\" This is a consequence of their actions, but doesn't indicate a prior misconception.\n*   **D. He thought they were friendly:** The situation clearly suggests they are hostile.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is that Potter initially mistook the Flap-jacks' appearance for something familiar - a blanket.\n\nA"

He wanted to get away from the farmers:** While he's dealing with them, this isn't his primary motivation. He's trying to achieve a larger strategic goal.\n*   **D. He wanted to capture a Flap-jack by surprise:** The text states \"He wanted to arrange a prisoner exchange\" and then says, \"Wait here. I'm going out alone.\" This implies a plan to engage the Flap-jacks strategically, suggesting he intends to capture one to facilitate the exchange.\n\nD"

They also discussed the concept of skirmishforms being used, reinforcing the idea that fighting was expected.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\nA"

This makes this option unlikely.\n*   **Option D:** The passage explicitly states, \u201cSuddenly I yearn for the crowded yellow sands of Jaq. I had hoped....I had hoped, Retief, to find a new land here where I might plan my own Mosaic, till these alien sands and bring forth such a crop of paradise-lichen as should glut the markets of a hundred worlds. But my spirit is not equal to the prospect of biterforms and gougerforms without end. I am shamed before you....\" and that \"I\u2019m enthralled with novel modes...but perhaps we could rule out tentacle-twisting, just to even it.\u201d This clearly indicates he prefers to observe rather than participate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n\n\nD"

While plausible, the story doesn't emphasize a sudden need for a title *at that moment*. It feels a bit too improvised for a formal title.\n*   **B:** This option implies a long-standing nickname given by colleagues due to Retief's bureaucratic habits. While Retief is portrayed as bureaucratic, the story doesn't give hints of a pre-existing nickname like this. It is possible, but not directly supported.\n*   **C:** This option proposes a spontaneous creation, but grounded in Retief's profession and the metaphorical \"mountains of red tape\" faced by bureaucrats. This aligns well with the character portrayal and the story's theme of bureaucratic procedures. It's the most logical explanation given the context.\n*   **D:** This option introduces a complex backstory about nobility and a hereditary title. This is highly unlikely, given the narrative's focus on a space-faring, bureaucratic setting. It adds unnecessary layers and isn't hinted at in the text.\n\nTherefore, option C is the most reasonable inference.\n\nC"

However, it doesn't say Retief *always* follows orders meticulously or that he's unimaginative. It's a character trait Passwyn *thinks* he has.\n*   **B:** This is accurate. Retief disembarks on a skiff before reaching Adobe, meaning he doesn't receive or read the sealed orders.\n*   **C:** The passage explicitly states that Passwyn said no one at Headquarters had visited Adobe, contradicting the assertion that they are experts.\n*   **D:** This aligns with the narrative. Retief\u2019s actions \u2013 taking the skiff, dealing with the pilot, his spontaneous actions upon landing, and the final resolution \u2013 all demonstrate a disregard for methodical procedures. He achieves the goal (a sort of peace) but not by following a pre-determined plan.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD"

The leader of the Flapjacks says that he and his group of followers came from another planet.** This aligns with the text where Hoshick expresses a desire to \"plan my own Mosaic,\" implying origin elsewhere.\n*   **B. True. Although Retief is surprised that the Flapjacks were not discovered before Terran colonization of the planet began, the Terran instruments simply could not detect them.** The text doesn't suggest the Flapjacks were undetectable, but rather that there was an initial misunderstanding about the planet's habitability.\n*   **C. True. \"Flapjack\" is a pejorative name for the group known as the Jaqs, which Passwyn tells Retief is an intelligent indigenous lifeform.** Passwyn does mention the Jaqs but the Flapjacks are clearly an alien group separate from the Jaqs.\n*   **D. False.
