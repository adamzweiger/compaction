Koroby is preparing for her wedding to Yasak, indicating they are set to get married.\n2. Koroby is described as feeling a sense of obligation towards Yasak, saying \"It will be nice to have Yasak for a husband\u2014yes. And perhaps I do love him. I don't know.\"\n3. Koroby's friends are mentioned as bridesmaids, suggesting a traditional wedding ceremony.\n4. Koroby's feelings towards Yasak are not portrayed as passionate or romantic, but rather lukewarm and uncertain.\n5. Koroby's primary focus is on her desire for romance and adventure, which is not fulfilled by Yasak.\n\nConsidering these points, it appears that Koroby is not deeply invested in her relationship with Yasak and is instead drawn to Robert, the stranger who has arrived on Venus.\n\n**C**"

The society appears to be a tribal or pre-industrial society, with \"clay huts\" and \"litter-bearers\".\n2. The people are described as having \"gnau\" and \"siatcha\" which are likely tools or objects that are not of modern technology.\n3. The planet is described as having a \"rusty red\" twilight and a perpetual \"ceiling of dust-clouds\", suggesting a primitive or underdeveloped environment.\n4. The people's way of life seems to be traditional and simple, with a focus on marriage and social customs.\n\nConsidering these clues, the society on Venus seems to be in a pre-industrial state, which would place it in a time period similar to the early stages of human history, roughly equivalent to the Iron Age.\n\nThe Iron Age is the period of human history when people began to use iron tools and develop more complex societies, but it is still a far cry from the industrial revolution.\n\nD"

However, Robert's death at the hands of Koroby, who had set fire to the grass to try and stop him from leaving, would have likely made her realize the gravity of her actions.\n\nConsidering the societal norms and expectations in the story, it's likely that Yasak, who had been understanding and kind to Koroby, would not banish her. Instead, he would likely be understanding of her actions, especially given the circumstances.\n\nGiven that Koroby was already injured and exhausted from the events of the story, it's unlikely that she would have had the physical ability to complete a spaceship to explore Terra.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that Koroby likely married Yasak.\n\nA."

Yasak is described as ordering his people to carry the litter-carriers who had fallen asleep, indicating he is in a position of authority.\n3. When Yasak sees Robert, he asks if he can carry Koroby, but Robert declines.\n4. Yasak then asks Robert to stay with him while he is in the City, and Robert agrees.\n5. As they walk, Yasak eyes Robert speculatively, suggesting he is interested in Robert's opinion or reaction to his authority.\n\nConsidering these points, Yasak seems to be trying to establish a connection with Robert, possibly to gauge his opinion of him or to assert his own authority. Therefore, Yasak's feelings towards Robert are likely positive, indicating a sense of curiosity or admiration.\n\n**B**"

The procession stops, and Koroby asks the bearers to take her towards the light.\n4. After some hesitation, they agree to take her towards the light.\n5.

When he finally turns to her, Koroby is smitten.\n8. Meanwhile, Yasak is searching for Koroby because the litter-bearers, who were carrying her, have stopped to investigate the strange noise and light.\n9. The bearers are unable to continue the procession, so they leave Koroby with the strange man and return to inform Yasak about what happened.\n10. Yasak sends a search party to look for Koroby, and they find her with the strange man.\n\nBased on this sequence of events, Yasak first reunites with Koroby when the searching party finds her with the strange man.\n\n**B**"

She's described as being \"voluptuous\" compared to her friends, suggesting that she may be marrying Yasak for security or status rather than love.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that Koroby is uncertain about marrying Yasak and may be doing so for practical reasons rather than love.\n\n**C**"

The text does not suggest that Koroby is a robot or that she is too young to understand the idea of space.\n\nBased on these points, the most likely reason Koroby does not have a concept of space is that she has never been able to see the stars or the sky due to the perpetual clouds on Venus.\n\nA"

This is hinted at when Yasak and the others exclaim that Robert is \"some kind of a toy made to look like a man\" and that he was \"conquered\" by humans, implying that humans have become so advanced that they can create robots that surpass their own capabilities.\n\nTherefore, the fate of humans on Earth is that they have become so advanced that they no longer need to physically travel to other planets, but rather send robots to do so for them.\n\nA"
