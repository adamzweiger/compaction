This assignment was a consequence of his previous indiscretions and his grounding.\n\n*   **If he hadn\u2019t gone to the chamber:** He wouldn't have been on Venus, actively pursuing Koerber. He would have remained grounded, likely performing a different, less exciting duty.\n\n*   **Analyzing the options:**\n    *   A. Bertram would have been upset - Bertram\u2019s frustration was tied to Dennis\u2019s failure to fulfill his duty. If Dennis hadn\u2019t been on Venus, Bertram wouldn\u2019t have had a reason to be upset.\n    *   B. Marla would not have been captured by Koerber - Marla\u2019s capture was a *result* of Dennis\u2019s presence on Venus, actively hunting Koerber\u2019s ships.\n    *   C. Koerber would not have been captured - Dennis\u2019s pursuit of Koerber was the key element in the story\u2019s climax.\n    *   D. Dennis would have been grounded - This is the most direct consequence of the initial premise.\n\n**D**"

It\u2019s presented as a last-ditch effort against a dangerous pirate.\n\nConsidering this, the most accurate reason is that they needed his skills and experience despite the grounding. The other options are incorrect:\n\n*   A: While bringing Koerber back alive might have been a goal, it wasn\u2019t the *sole* reason for sending him.\n*   B: The text doesn't suggest the grounding was in error.\n*   C: There\u2019s no indication he was sent by mistake.\n\n**A**"

The passage states, \"Dennis Brooke was thirty, the time when youth no longer seems unending. When the minor adventures of the heart begin to pall. If the loss of Marla left an aching void that all the women of five planets could not fill, the loss of Space, was quite as deadly.\" This clearly indicates that Dennis had previously experienced extensive travel and space missions \u2013 it\u2019s become routine and perhaps even dull for him. He\u2019s grown weary of it.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A. He disliked flying lightning fast:** The text mentions the cruiser is \"a new design... the speed of the thing that you'll want to know about,\" suggesting he\u2019s accustomed to fast travel.\n*   **B. He\u2019d never spent sleepless nights in eternal vigilance:** The passage explicitly states he *had* spent sleepless nights, indicating this isn't a new experience for him.\n*   **C. He did not have his usual luxurious office onboard:** The description of the cruiser\u2019s less-luxurious interior points to a shift in his routine, not a lack of familiarity with space travel.\n*   **D. He was the only one who had been to the outer planets before:** The text implies that the mission to this new planetoid was a common type of duty, and that Dennis had spent significant time exploring similar areas.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is D.\n\nD"

Dennis acknowledges Randall\u2019s inexperience (\u201c...the youngster\u2026\u201d) and his distress during the crash landing.\n2.  He recognizes that Randall\u2019s failure wasn\u2019t malicious but likely stemmed from fear (\u201c...he was gripped by paralyzing hysteria\u2026\u201d)\n3.  Dennis recalls his own experience with Koerber and the consequences of his actions, admitting to a \u201csevere rebuff\u201d and loss of heart. This suggests an understanding of what it's like to be overwhelmed by a difficult situation.\n\nConsidering these points, it\u2019s clear Dennis isn't simply dismissing Randall\u2019s error. Instead, he\u2019s demonstrating empathy for a young man experiencing a terrifying and overwhelming situation, much as he had himself. Option A is incorrect as he isn't angry at Dallas. Option B is an overstatement; he doesn\u2019t think Randall has *no* place in the I.S.P., but rather recognizes his inexperience. Option D is incorrect \u2013 Dennis doesn't believe Randall is a coward.\n\nD"
