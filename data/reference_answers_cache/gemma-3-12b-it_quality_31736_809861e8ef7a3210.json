As punishment for dissenting against the MDC:** The text mentions Gavir's father was killed by the MDC for organizing resistance, and Gavir harbored vengeance. However, it doesn't state Gavir himself was brought to Earth as punishment.\n*   **B. Because he was the first Martian that humans had encountered:** The text states Gavir is \"the first native Martian to appear on the dreamwaves.\" This suggests he wasn't necessarily the first Martian encountered, but the first to be showcased publicly.\n*   **C. To perform in a dreamwave performance:** The text explicitly states that Gavir was brought to Earth by Dr. Malcomb Rice to be part of a \"dreamwave\" performance, marking him as the first Martian to appear on this platform.\n*   **D. As part of a labor pool:** The text mentions the MDC uses Martians in labor pools and mines, but it does not state that this was the reason for Gavir's arrival on Earth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nC"

To hide from persecution for the crimes he committed:** There's no mention of Gavir committing crimes.\n*   **C. To kill the president of the MDC in an act of revenge:** This is explicitly stated as a primary motivation. His father was murdered by the MDC's head, and Gavir desires vengeance.\n*   **D.

All of the malevolent people are sent to Mars:** The story mentions MDC as a corporation operating *on* Mars, implying they are *from* Earth, not exiled. This option doesn't quite fit.\n*   **B. There is no more inequality in Earth's society:** The story highlights the Century-Plus individuals who have broken away from societal norms, suggesting inequality and underlying issues still exist.\n*   **C. People live to be much older and are more calm because of this:** While longevity is mentioned (150-year lifespan), the calmness isn't directly attributed to age. There are also Century-Plus individuals who are violent.\n*   **D. They undergo ethical conditioning:** The text explicitly mentions \"Ethical Conditioning\" and its role in suppressing aggressive impulses. The producer defends his behavior by citing it and Malcomb reinforces this idea, explaining it keeps society from \"fissioning.\" This is the most direct explanation provided in the text.\n\nD"

A half-dozen Earthmen approached him, stopped and stared. Gavir stared back. The Earthmen turned to one another. 'A Martian.' 'Let's give pain and death to the Martian! It will be a new experience\u2014one to savor.'\" This clearly indicates the attack was prompted by Gavir being a Martian.\n\nNow let's consider the options:\n\n*   **A:** While some Earthmen later become Senile Delinquents, this doesn't explain the *initial* attack.\n*   **B:** The MDC is mentioned later as a source of conflict, but not as the reason for this initial encounter.\n*   **C:** This aligns perfectly with the text's description of the Earthmen reacting to Gavir's Martian identity with hostile intent.\n*   **D:** The passage doesn't mention Gavir offending them by staring.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nC"

He wanted to buy some Earth books to learn more about the Earthlings:** The text explicitly states Gavir wanted to find a bookstore to buy books because Father James said \"In books there is power.\"\n*   **D. He wanted to hide in order to avoid being sent back to Mars:** The text doesn't suggest he wanted to hide, and mentions he'd be sent back if he was deemed to have behaved poorly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nC"

He had lived on Mars for too long:** The text states that living on Mars makes people \"different,\" but this doesn't directly explain his hostile tone.\n*   **C. He had never undergone the ethical conditioning:** The text mentions ethical conditioning is widespread on Earth and suppresses aggression, but doesn't indicate Spurling has never had it.\n*   **D. He was a \"senile delinquent\" and had outgrown his ethical conditioning:** The story explicitly states that Spurling's ability to speak hostilely is because he is a \"Century-Plus\" individual, and therefore a senile delinquent who has \"outgrown their Ethical Conditioning.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nD"

It's more of a consequence of his character.\n*   **B. His different appearance, especially his blue skin:** The text explicitly mentions Sylvie commenting on his \"gorgeous blue skin\" and notes that he is called \"Blue Boy.\" It\u2019s clear his unique appearance contributes to his appeal.\n*   **C. His amazing singing voice:** While he does sing, his voice is described as poor, and it\u2019s the *transmission* of the song's imagery, not his voice itself, that resonates with the audience.\n*   **D. His untamed, barbaric nature:** The text describes Century-Plussers as having \"outgrown their Ethical Conditioning\" and embracing a \"Century-Plus mentality.\" Gavir\u2019s perceived \"barbaric\" nature, his lack of adherence to Earth\u2019s rules and emotional control, is highlighted as a key reason for their fascination and appreciation.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D.\n\nD"

Gaivir had imagined Spurling's face on an animal that he had killed in a dreamvision:** This is explicitly stated in the text. Gavir sang the *Song of the Blood Feud* and pictured Spurling's face on the creature he killed. This angered Spurling.\n*   **C. Spurling was secretly in love with Silvie and jealous of Gaivir:** There's no mention of romantic feelings between Spurling and Sylvie.\n*   **D.

Emigrants:** While Martians *are* technically emigrants (having been brought to Earth), this doesn't fully capture the story's focus on power dynamics and resistance.\n   * **B. Europeans:** This is an interesting consideration given historical parallels of colonization and exploitation. However, it's not a direct, explicit symbol within the text.\n   * **C. They do not symbolize anything:** This is unlikely, given the nuanced depiction of the Martians and the clear themes of oppression and resistance.\n   * **D. Indigenous peoples:** This aligns strongly with the story's themes. Martians are native to their planet, displaced and exploited by a dominant Earth culture, mirroring historical experiences of indigenous populations.\n\nD"

They are described as living \"wildly\" and \"violently,\" seeking to \"do what I wanted to do\" and trying \"ridiculous things, disgusting things, vicious things.\" The characters seem to crave new experiences, even negative ones, as a response to the suppression of their natural impulses.

Song:** The story mentions Gavir singing \"the Song of Going to Hunt\" and \"the Song of Creation\" and \"the Song of Complaint.\" These songs appear to convey narratives and experiences, suggesting song is a storytelling method.\n*   **B. Dreamcasting:** Dreamcasting is used to transmit thoughts and experiences to Earthmen, but it is a technology adopted from Earth. The Martians don't inherently use it.\n*   **C. Oral tradition:** The story highlights Gavir's learning about power from \"books,\" so oral tradition isn't the primary method described.\n*   **D. Written word:** Father James mentions that \"in books there is power,\" but the story doesn\u2019t portray Martians regularly using written words to tell stories.\n\nTherefore, the passage most strongly suggests that Martians tell their stories through song.\n\nA"

Gavir is sad:** Gavir's sadness is not related to the nickname.\n*   **C. Gavir's whole race is blue:** The text states Gavir has \"hairless blue skull\" and \"blue skin,\" so it's a descriptor of his race. However, the negative reaction suggests it's more than just a simple descriptor. Spurling finds it demeaning, referring to him as \"a Bluie\".\n*   **D. Because Sylvie came up with it:** While Sylvie suggests it, the offensiveness stems from it being a reductionist label applied to someone of a different race/origin, not solely because of who suggested it.\n\nConsidering the context of Spurling's reaction and the way he uses the term \"Bluie\" dismissively, it suggests the nickname is demeaning because it reduces Gavir to a single, superficial characteristic of his race.\n\nC"

Gavir\u2019s actions are motivated by a deep-seated injustice and loss. The narrative doesn't explicitly portray revenge as \"bad.\"\n*   **C. Entertainment is influential:** This is a strong theme. The story shows how Gavir's dreamcast broadcasts directly impact the thoughts and actions of viewers, particularly the Century-Plussers. It demonstrates the immense power of media and its ability to stir emotions and incite action.\n*   **D. Revenge is good:** Similar to option B, the story doesn't explicitly state that revenge is \"good.\" It simply presents Gavir's journey towards it.\n\nTherefore, the most suitable theme is that entertainment is influential.\n\nC"
