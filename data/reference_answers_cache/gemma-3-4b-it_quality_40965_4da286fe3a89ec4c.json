She also reveals that she\u2019s been observing and manipulating him, subtly influencing his choices. Robert initially expresses shock and disbelief, referring to her as a \u201cscheming witch.\u201d He is deeply hurt by her deception and the realization that he's been unknowingly used.

The text emphasizes her being \"young and beautiful\" upon arrival, implying significant time has passed. A single year is too short; 100 years seems excessive without further context, and 10 years doesn't account for the immense distances and time dilation involved. Given the scale of the journey and Ninon's advanced age at the end, a timeframe of approximately 10 years seems plausible.\n\nD"

However, the core of her plan lies in manipulating Time itself through faster-than-light travel. She explicitly states, \u201cIf you can't whip 'em, join 'em!\u201d and \u201cIf you could just take me with you, Robert....\" and later, \"If people travel at the speed of light they won't get any older?\" She believes that by traveling faster than light, she could essentially reverse the effects of aging.\n\nA. She believed one flight was enough to make her youth eternal upon returning to Earth \u2013 Incorrect. The text describes her planning for *repeated* journeys.\nB. She believed that returning to Earth many, many years in the future there would be technologies to make humans live forever \u2013 Incorrect. The focus is on manipulating Time directly, not relying on future technology.\nC. Eternal youth was what she believed she would achieve in death \u2013 Incorrect. She is actively pursuing youth, not accepting it as a state after death.\nD. Once traveling faster than light was possible, she thought she might continually do this to remain young \u2013 This aligns perfectly with her overall strategy.\n\nD"

He's fascinated by the possibility of traveling faster than light and experiencing a different kind of time. Furthermore, he expresses a deep sadness about the prospect of aging and losing Ninon to time. While he mentions the experimental flight, the underlying theme is clearly his yearning for a connection with Ninon that transcends the limitations of time.\n\nA.

He needed to escape his life on Earth \u2013 There's no indication he's unhappy or seeking to escape his life.\nC. He was after eternal youth himself \u2013 This aligns perfectly with Ninon\u2019s motivations and the story\u2019s central theme.

She calculates everything, from the angle of the light to the timing of events.\n\n2. **Smart:** She understands and manipulates the theoretical physics of time travel, referencing complex concepts and demonstrating a strategic intellect.\n\n3. **Desperate:** Her entire existence revolves around defying time and death, highlighting a profound and consuming desperation. She\u2019s willing to do anything to maintain her youth, even manipulating others.\n\n4. **Cunning:** She uses Robert to her advantage, playing with his emotions and manipulating him into actions that serve her goals.\n\n5. **Omniscient (partially):** She seems to possess extensive knowledge about Robert and his plans, indicating a level of awareness beyond what is readily apparent.\n\nConsidering these points, option D, \u201ceager, cunning, and desperate,\u201d most accurately captures the essence of Ninon\u2019s character.\n\nD"

This suggests a controlling dynamic.\n\n2.  **Shared Goal:** They both have a desire to manipulate time and achieve eternal youth. This indicates a connection based on a specific ambition.\n\n3.  **Robert\u2019s Disappointment:** When Ninon reveals her long life and uses him to demonstrate her control over time, Robert is deeply hurt and disillusioned. He sees her as a manipulator and a cheat.\n\n4.  **Ninon's Lack of Remorse:** Ninon doesn't seem bothered by Robert\u2019s feelings. She uses him as a tool to prove her point and continues her pursuit of youth.\n\n5.  **The Recording:** The recording of their interaction further confirms that Ninon was intentionally creating a scenario to showcase her abilities and Robert\u2019s eventual demise.\n\nConsidering these points, the relationship isn\u2019t one of genuine friendship or rivalry. It\u2019s a transactional, manipulative dynamic where Ninon exploits Robert\u2019s desires. Robert is ultimately used and discarded.\n\n**D**"

She deliberately creates distance and uses phrases like \u201cNot yet, Robert\u201d and \u201cWait!\u201d to control him.\n\n2. **Robert\u2019s Feelings:** Robert expresses strong feelings for Ninon (\"You are so beautiful. Let me look at you for a long time\u2014to carry your image with me through all of time and space.\"). However, Ninon consistently deflects his advances and treats him as a tool.\n\n3. **The Scheme:** Ninon\u2019s entire plan revolves around using Robert\u2019s flight to essentially \u201cborrow\u201d his youth and vitality, and then using the ship's capabilities to travel through time, ensuring her continued youth. She doesn't seem to genuinely care about him beyond his utility.\n\n4. **Robert's Reaction at the End:** When Ninon reveals her scheme and that he will be aging while she remains young, Robert is devastated and horrified. He doesn't attempt to stop her, but instead expresses regret and a sense of betrayal.\n\nConsidering these points, option A most accurately portrays the dynamic: Ninon sees Robert as a means to an end, using his affections to achieve her goal of eternal youth, while Robert genuinely cares for her.\n\nB is incorrect because Ninon\u2019s actions demonstrate manipulation, not simply using Robert as a pawn.\nC is too ambiguous; the text strongly suggests a transactional, rather than mutual, connection.\nD is incorrect because Robert actively participates in her scheme and doesn't exhibit any behavior suggesting he would abandon her.\n\n**A**"

Ninon\u2019s entire motivation is to maintain a youthful appearance and feel. Her reliance on numerous medical interventions \u2013 bio-knives, lotions, diets, etc. \u2013 is what allows her to believe she can manipulate time and essentially \u201cdestroy\u201d it to remain young. If she hadn't undergone all these procedures, her body would have naturally aged, likely leading to stiffness, reduced resilience, and a generally older appearance. This would have made it impossible for her to convincingly pretend to be younger than Robert. Furthermore, she needed the strength and vitality to hijack the flight and assert her control.\n\nConsidering this, let\u2019s examine the options:\n\n*   **A.** While it\u2019s possible she might have dated someone her age, the text heavily implies that her obsession with youth was centered around Robert and the *fantasy* of traveling with him.\n*   **B.** Her age was a key element in her plan to hijack the flight; without the procedures, she simply wouldn\u2019t have been able to deceive Robert.\n*   **C.** If she hadn\u2019t had the procedures, she would have looked older, aligning with the natural progression of aging. She might have felt more fulfilled by simply accepting her age rather than constantly striving for a fabricated youth.\n*   **D.** Her body\u2019s condition, due to the procedures, was crucial for withstanding the stresses of faster-than-light travel. Without them, she wouldn't have been able to handle the physical demands.\n\nTherefore, the most logical consequence is that she wouldn't have been able to hijack the flight.\n\nD"
