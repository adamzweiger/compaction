      "generated_text": "Blake's night with Eldoria is mentioned in the beginning of the story, and it is stated that he goes out into the Dubhe 4 night after buying a bottle of native whiskey at the bar. \n\nLater, Blake finds himself in his own mind-world, where he remembers a house where he lived at a much later date. It is mentioned that the places in his mind-world are as far apart in miles as they are in years. \n\nBlake also remembers a conversation with Deirdre, his protegee, who is graduating from Trevor University. \n\nGiven this information, it can be inferred that the events that occurred in the house in Blake's mind-world are in the future of the events that occurred with Eldoria.\n\nThe conversation with Deirdre at the university is mentioned as having occurred two days ago. \n\nTherefore, the time that has passed between Blake's night with Eldoria and his search for Sabrina York in his mind-world is 2 days.\n\nHowever, the options do not include 2 days, so I will choose the option that is closest in time.\n\nB"

Deirdre gets upset and defensive, suggesting that Blake is implying he's her father.\n3. She mentions that she knows he wouldn't take her to the prom himself, implying that he's being hypocritical.\n4. She emphasizes that the young man has made sacrifices to take her to the prom, which suggests that Deirdre values the thought and effort behind the invitation, rather than the person himself.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC"

      "generated_text": "To determine why Blake created the three female super-images, let's break down the information given in the story.\n\nBlake is a psycheye, a professional who can enter people's minds. He is hired to track down a woman named Sabrina York, who has hidden herself in his mind. As he navigates his own mind-world, he encounters three super-images: Miss Stoddart, Officer Finch, and Vera Velvetskin. These super-images are not just ordinary memory-images; they are vivid and aware, and they seem to be malevolent towards Blake.\n\nThe story doesn't explicitly state why Blake created these super-images, but it does provide some context about his relationships and emotions. Blake has a complex emotional life, with a history of relationships and experiences that are influencing his current situation.\n\nOption A suggests that Blake feels guilty about having slept with Eldoria, which perpetuated the demand for female prostitution. However, this is not directly related to the creation of the three super-images.\n\nOption B suggests that Blake feels guilty about hunting down Sabrina York. While this might be a relevant theme in the story, it doesn't directly explain the creation of the super-images.\n\nOption C suggests that Blake is still grieving his mother's death and regrets not being a more loving son. This is a possible motivation for Blake's emotions, but it's not directly connected to the creation of the super-images.\n\nOption D suggests that Blake feels guilty about hurting Deirdre's feelings after her graduation. This is the most relevant option, as Blake's interaction with Deirdre is a recent event that has left a strong emotional impact on him. The story implies that Blake has romantic feelings for Deirdre, but he chose to play the role of a parent, which hurt her feelings. This could be a reason why Blake's subconscious created the three malevolent super-images, as a manifestation of his guilt and emotional pain.\n\n**D**"

There is no indication that she is Eldoria's alter ego.\n\nThe correct answer is A."

Deirdre explained to Blake that she was living with Eldoria and was to be sent to a mission school and later to an institute of higher learning.\n4. After Deirdre left, Eldoria arrived, and Blake went with her to her quarters.\n5. Later, Blake found himself in his own mind, and he began his chase of Sabrina in his mind-world, which started in his own house.\n\nSince Blake's house is not explicitly mentioned as a physical location, but rather as a location in his mind-world, and it is based on his memory, the correct answer would be the location that corresponds to his memory of his house.\n\nThe location that matches this description is his parents' house, where he remembered his mother preparing a meal, and it is also a location in his past.\n\nSo, the correct answer is: \nB"
