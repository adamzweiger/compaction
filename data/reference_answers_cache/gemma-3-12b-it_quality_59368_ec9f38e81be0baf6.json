      "generated_text": "Let's analyze the passage to determine why Ronnie was hoping something bad would happen to his father.\n\nThe passage states, \"Maybe Dad would have an accident. Maybe\u2014 He bit his lip hard, shook his head. No. No matter what Dad might do, it wasn't right to wish\u2014\" This clearly indicates Ronnie's wish was related to avoiding a confrontation with his father. The following lines reveal the reason: Ronnie was afraid his father would discover Ronnie was reading, and subsequently punish him.\n\nNow let's look at the options:\nA. This is not mentioned in the text.\nB. This aligns directly with the passage. Ronnie feared his father would find out about his reading.\nC. This is a consequence of the situation, but not Ronnie's initial hope.\nD. This is not mentioned in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nB"

She had to tell Dad about Ronnie's mis-behaviour:** The text states she had to tell Dad that Ronnie was reading a book, and this caused a significant reaction from Dad. This aligns with her being upset.\n*   **B. She was worried Dad might hit her again:** Later in the story, Dad slaps Mom, suggesting this is a potential concern. Her disheveled appearance could be a result of the emotional turmoil following this confrontation.\n*   **C. She had been working at the corporation all day:** There's no mention of her working at a corporation.\n*   **D. She had not finished making dinner for Dad:** This is not mentioned in the passage.\n\nConsidering the evidence, both A and B are plausible. However, B seems to be the stronger answer as her appearance being \"disheveled\" points more directly to emotional distress and the potential for violence than simply having to deliver bad news.\n\nA"

His father, a high-ranking government official, fears this knowledge will jeopardize his career and standing.\n*   **Memory-washing's Purpose:** The father initially suggests memory-washing to erase the two years Ronnie spent learning to read. This would effectively remove the \"forbidden\" knowledge and prevent Ronnie from potentially exposing his father.\n*   **Why other options are wrong:**\n    *   A - It's the opposite. Memory washing would hinder learning.\n    *   C - Going to school isn't the core issue here; it's the reading itself.\n    *   D - While the incident is troubling, the primary reason for the memory wash is Ronnie\u2019s ability to read, not the domestic violence.\n\nB"

People who read are called \"Readers\" and are viewed with suspicion and fear. The government and corporations actively try to suppress reading.\n*   **Analyzing the Options:**\n    *   **A. To save paper for environmental purposes:** While environmental concerns are possible in a futuristic setting, the story's emphasis is on control and secrecy, not resource conservation.\n    *   **B. To make the population have a lower intelligence:** This is a possible implication, but the story's core reason seems more focused on control than intentionally lowering intelligence.\n    *   **C. To control what content the population was able to consume:** This aligns perfectly with the story. The need to keep information \"Restricted, Confidential, Top-Secret\" highlights a desire to manage what people know and think. The characters explicitly state that secrecy is crucial for maintaining power and control within the government and corporations.\n    *   **D. So that readers could retain their power:** The opposite is true; readers are seen as a threat *to* power, not holders of it.\n\nC"

The text explicitly states, \"Dad said...you can't keep a two-year memory-wash a secret. I never thought of that before. Why, that alone would mean the end of my promotions.\" This directly links the inability to proceed with the memory wash to potential damage to his career.\n*   **B. Ronnie would just learn to read again:** While there's a concern about Ronnie unconsciously remembering how to read, this isn't the *reason* Dad abandons the idea. It's a consequence, not the initial deterrent.\n*   **C. The technology wouldn't work on someone so young:** The text doesn't suggest the technology's efficacy is age-dependent.\n*   **D. Ronnie had already ingrained reading in his memory permanently:** The text doesn't state that reading is permanently ingrained.\n\nA"

They knew that they would be able to read at the Davis house:** While reading is a significant theme, the primary reason for going isn't explicitly stated as access to reading materials.\n*   **C. Mr. Davis had offered Ronnie a place to stay whenever:** The text states, \"Hi, Kenny. Who's that? Your mom?\" \"Hi. Who's that? Your mom?\" \"Sure.\" This implies a pre-existing and welcoming arrangement, suggesting Mr. Davis offered Ronnie a place to stay.\n*   **D.

Dad expresses surprise and disapproval at Ronnie's ability to read. Mom's own history of reading is treated as a transgression.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A.

High IQ, no mechanical abilities:** The story doesn't suggest a specific IQ is needed, and mechanical abilities are also irrelevant.\n*   **C. Government credentials:** The story explicitly states reading is discouraged by the government. Credentials would be the opposite of what\u2019s needed.\n*   **D. Status, allegiance:** The story implies that those with societal status and allegiance to the government are *not* expected to read.
