That was why we were looking at it so analytically.\" It then discusses possible causes, including transphasia, and the captain initially suspects hostile natives knocking down their \"Big Brother kites.\" However, he ultimately concludes it might be something beyond familiar transphasia.\n\nTherefore, while he considers transphasia, his initial thought is that the kites were knocked down.\n\nD"

But I might be doing the wrong thing, but I can see you would be doing it wrong. Listen,\" I continued earnestly, \"these men aren't going to think of me\u2014of us, the officers, as their leaders. As far as the crew is concerned, Ordinary Spaceman Quade is the best man on this ship.\" This implies that the narrator wasn't previously an officer on this ship and is new to the role of captain. He was a lapidary in civilian life (B is mentioned, but that's not the reason for his first trip). There is no mention of him ever being an ordinary spaceman (C) or an officer on Earth (D). The most relevant clue indicates he was a lapidary, implying a civilian background, and therefore, this is his first time as Captain.\n\nA\n\n\n\nA"

He was less cautious than others:** The text explicitly states Quade was criticized for his reliance on tradition and a lack of caution, leading to his \"busting\" to Ordinary Spaceman. This contradicts the statement.\n*   **B. He wished he was getting hazard pay:** While he mentions hazard pay multiple times, it seems more like a justification for his complacency rather than a deep desire. It's a secondary concern compared to the events unfolding.\n*   **C. It was completely unfamiliar to him:** Quade repeatedly claims to be an experienced spaceman familiar with transphasia, indicating he's not entirely new to unusual situations.\n*   **D. He was more cautious than others:** The text portrays Quade as confident in his experience and routines, almost to a fault. Initially, he dismisses the Captain\u2019s concerns and insists on his own understanding of the situation. However, by the end, he admits he was a \"blind, arrogant, cocksure fool\" and realizes the dangers of relying solely on past experience. This suggests he *was* initially more confident (and arguably overconfident), making him seem more cautious in his approach because he felt he already knew how things worked.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is D.\n\nD"

You can't trust anything.\"). He also remarks that the captain is \"a figurehead\" and implies the captain is reactionary. Later, Quade expresses bitterness towards the captain's height (\"I noticed in irritation it was still an inch less than Quade's.\") and suggests the captain was foolish.\n\nHowever, after the events on the planet and the captain\u2019s demonstrated resourcefulness, Quade acknowledges his own past arrogance and foolishness, stating \"I've been a blind, arrogant, cocksure fool...\". This demonstrates a shift, but the earlier statements strongly indicate a feeling of superiority at the beginning. Therefore, while he later admits fault, the dominant sentiment initially was one of superiority.\n\nC"

Transphasia is described as an \"electrogravitational disturbance of incoming sense data, rechanneling it to the wrong receptive areas.\" This means senses get mixed up \u2013 sight becomes sound, taste becomes smell, etc.\n\nA. Feeling an earthquake: Earthquakes are physical events felt through the sense of touch. Transphasia could conceivably rechannel this tactile sensation to another sensory area.\n\nB. Smelling the color red: This aligns perfectly with the described sensory mixing \u2013 sight (color) becoming smell.\n\nC. Hearing the sunlight: This also aligns with the mixing of senses - sight (sunlight) becoming sound.\n\nD. Tasting a cry for help: This is also a reasonable example of transphasia, rechanneling sound to the sense of taste.\n\nThe key here is that transphasia deals with *rechanneling* existing sensory input. Feeling an earthquake is a physical sensation in itself, not a sensory input that would need to be rechanneled.\n\nA"

The dog came to him when it wanted somebody to own it, protect it, feed it, love it. These aliens want Earthmen to colonize the planet. We came here, you see, same as the dog came to Nagurski.\"\n\nThen, Quade responds with, \"Well, I\u2019ve learned one thing from all of this,\" and then makes an admission that he was a \"blind, arrogant, cocksure fool\". Afterwards, he states, \"Maybe it's worth it,\" and \"Now maybe I've learned how to stay alive out here. I just hope I don't forget.\" This suggests he recognized the truth in my statement and feels a degree of regret for his past behavior and a newfound humility. This aligns with thinking it was ugly and/or incorrect.\n\nNow, let\u2019s consider the options:\nA. That it was pretty - Doesn't fit his tone of regret.\nB. That it was ugly - This seems to be the closest to his reaction.\nC. That it left a bad taste - While potentially true, it doesn't directly reflect his sentiment.\nD. That it was incorrect - This is also accurate, but \u201cugly\u201d better captures the tone of regret.\n\nTherefore, \"ugly\" seems to be the most accurate descriptor of his feelings.\n\nB"

Talking:** While communication occurred, it wasn't presented as a mitigation strategy.\n*   **B. Moving around:** Movement actually seemed to exacerbate the effects, as they worsened when they moved away from the ship.\n*   **C. The training of the spacemen:** Quade's experience was initially relied upon, but ultimately it was found to be a hindrance as it led to complacency. The training itself isn't depicted as helpful.\n*   **D. The ship:** The text explicitly states that the ship served as a point of reference and stability, allowing them to maintain a sense of reality. They needed physical contact with the ship via a cable to remain oriented.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nD"

I'm a notch nearer retirement too.\" This directly indicates that Nagurski was happy to be First Officer because it allowed him to earn more money and move closer to retirement.\n*   Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:\n    *   A: While there was some tension between Nagurski and the Captain, the passage doesn't say the crew didn't trust him.\n    *   B: The passage states Nagurski *was* suspicious of everything, the opposite of what this option says.\n    *   D: While reduced stress might be a side benefit, the passage explicitly mentions the financial and retirement aspects.\n\nC"

He believes there is a special bond between service people:** While there's a mention of familiarity between crew members, it's not presented as a positive bond. The relationship is strained.\n*   **B.

They question his decisions and experience.\n*   **C. He doesn\u2019t care if they respect him or not:** Gavin clearly *does* care. He's bothered by their disrespect and attempts to assert his authority, though unsuccessfully.\n*   **D. When he was promoted above his comrades, they began to resent him:** This aligns perfectly with the narrative. Quade's attitude and the crew's general skepticism towards Gavin's leadership directly stem from his being in a position of authority over them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD"

He describes experiencing \"smelling sensations, tasting sounds, hearing sights, seeing tastes, touching odors.\" This clearly indicates modified sensory experiences. He is also initially overwhelmed and confused by it.\n\n*   **Quade's experience:** Quade claims to be experienced with transphasia. He explains the phenomenon and seems initially calm about it. However, later in the story, it\u2019s revealed he\u2019s being affected - he's eventually flattened by an alien and seems disoriented. Despite this, he portrays himself as someone who's dealt with it before.\n\nTherefore, both characters experience altered sensory perceptions due to transphasia.\n\nA."

Gavin thinks the First Officer wants to take his job:** The text suggests the opposite. Nagurski seems content with his position and is nearing retirement, valuing hazard pay over captaincy. Gavin perceives Nagurski's relaxed approach as complacency and a lack of trust in him, not an ambition to usurp his role.\n*   **B. The First Officer only interacts with Gavin using Quade as an intermediary:** They directly converse throughout the story, debating approaches and offering advice.\n*   **C. Gavin trusts him so much as to go together on space expeditions, but not further:** Gavin actively dislikes Nagurski's judgement and goes on an expedition *despite* his advice, not because of trust.\n*   **D. Gavin learns important lessons in leadership from him:** While Nagurski offers advice, Gavin consistently dismisses it, seeing it as evidence of Nagurski's flawed thinking and complacency. There's no indication of Gavin learning from him. Gavin ultimately criticizes Nagurski's methods, portraying him as someone who trusts his crew too much, while Gavin believes in firm control.\n\nTherefore, none of the options are correct, but Option A is the *closest*.\n\nA"

Perception is all relative:** While the story highlights how senses can be distorted and perceptions altered by transphasia, the core of the story isn't about the subjective nature of perception itself.\n*   **B. Sometimes inexperience can produce innovation:** The Captain, initially dismissive of Quade\u2019s experience and tradition, eventually acknowledges that his own fresh perspective and willingness to deviate from established procedures leads to a potential solution (understanding the aliens). This aligns well with the narrative's arc.\n*   **C. A learner\u2019s mind is very dangerous in space, best to have experienced people in charge:** The story actively challenges this idea. Quade, despite his experience, is complacent and resistant to new ideas, while the Captain's inexperience ultimately proves helpful.\n*   **D. Save yourself before helping others is the lesson they live by:** There's no indication that this is a guiding principle for either character. They work together and ultimately demonstrate a degree of cooperation.\n\nTherefore, option B best captures the story's lesson.\n\nB"

He dismisses the Captain's concerns and considers himself superior due to his long tenure. However, his insistence on following established procedures nearly leads to disaster. The events on the planet challenge his assumptions, and he recognizes he was \"blind, arrogant, cocksure\" and \"foolhardy.\" While he isn't necessarily pessimistic, he definitely loses his initial, unwavering confidence. Instead, he develops a healthy skepticism and a recognition of the limitations of relying solely on past experience. The ending suggests he's more willing to question established methods.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of his change is that his confidence is replaced by healthy skepticism.\n\nB"
