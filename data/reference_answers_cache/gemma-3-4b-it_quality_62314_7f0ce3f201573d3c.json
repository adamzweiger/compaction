She repeatedly wishes for someone \u201cto drop out of the skies\u201d to whisk her away.\n3. **Koroby\u2019s Rebellion:** She actively avoids her wedding preparations and then deliberately sabotages her wedding by running off toward the strange man.\n4. **Yasak\u2019s Reaction:** Yasak is simply annoyed by Koroby\u2019s behavior and treats her harshly when she returns, dismissing her as a \u201cfool\u201d.\n5. **Lack of Affection:** There\u2019s no indication of Yasak being attentive or caring. He\u2019s pragmatic, focused on the wedding, and quickly moves on when she returns.\n\nBased on this, Koroby is faithfully devoted to Yasak, but falls in love with Robert.\n\nD"
