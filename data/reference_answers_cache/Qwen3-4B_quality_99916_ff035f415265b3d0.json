The article starts by talking about how there's a decline in trust in representative democracy, with examples like Brexit and Trump. The author acknowledges that people feel democracy isn't working for them, which suggests some criticism.\n\nBut then the author introduces blockchain-based systems as a potential alternative, suggesting that maybe a new form of democracy could address these issues. However, the author also points out problems with these systems, like their reliance on property ownership and the fact that they aren't immune to hacks. The author seems to be cautious, pointing out both the potential and the flaws.\n\nThe question is about the author's general attitude. The options are: A. They believe it does nothing, B. They believe it could make both positive and negative impacts, C. They believe it has the power to do great evil, D. They believe it has the power to make positive change.\n\nThe author doesn't entirely dismiss democracy but is critical of its current state and the new tech solutions. They mention that blockchain-based systems have potential but also significant issues. The author seems to think that while there are problems, there's also a possibility for positive change, but with caution. So maybe B or D. However, the article also says that the current democratic processes are failing, but the author is open to the idea of a new form of democracy. The answer might be B because the author acknowledges both the potential and the risks.\n</think>\n\nB"

That suggests that authoritarian governments (option C) are a big concern. \n\nBut then the author discusses blockchain and distributed consensus as potential solutions. However, the author later points out that these technologies have issues, like the confusion between the political meaning of \"consensus\" and the technical one. Also, the author is critical of blockchain-based systems because they involve property ownership and aren't truly democratic in practice. \n\nThe author mentions that the problem with distributed consensus is a misunderstanding, and that blockchain systems are based on values that conflict with the principles of the commons.

The options are A to D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the article's main points. The author talks about how people are dissatisfied with traditional democracy, feeling that elites are not representing them. They mention events like Brexit, Trump, and authoritarian trends in various countries. The author argues that democracy isn't working for the people, leading them to support strong leaders or movements. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nOption B says democracy has failed to represent the people. That aligns with the author's point about the failure of conventional democracy. The article states that democracies are struggling with crises and that people feel their will isn't being represented. \n\nOption A is about blockchain being too hard to understand. The author mentions that some people misunderstand blockchain, but that's more about the confusion around the technology, not the reason for radical movements. \n\nOption C refers to propaganda. The article doesn't focus on propaganda as the main reason; instead, it's about the failure of democracy. \n\nOption D suggests it's a natural evolution. The author seems critical of the current state of democracy, not seeing it as a natural progression. \n\nSo the correct answer is B. The author believes radical movements are taking hold because democracy isn't working, leading people to reject it.\n</think>\n\nB"

The options are A to D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the article said. The article discusses blockchain technology and how it's used in the context of democracy. The key part here is explaining what \"distributed consensus\" means. The text mentions that in the Bitcoin network, distributed consensus is the process where all computers in the network agree on the validity of a transaction through calculations. It's a technical term related to the blockchain's validation process.\n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA. Electorates representing public vote \u2013 that sounds like traditional democracy, not the technical term here. \n\nB. Basic income in cryptocurrency \u2013 the article doesn't mention basic income, so probably not B.\n\nC. Coalition government requiring cooperation \u2013 that's more about political structures, not the technical consensus mechanism.\n\nD. Group decision making non-hierarchical \u2013 the article talks about non-hierarchical groups using blockchain for decisions, which aligns with D. The term \"distributed consensus\" in the context of the article refers to how decisions are made in a decentralized, non-hierarchical way through the blockchain's process. \n\nThe article also mentions that \"distributed consensus\" is about the technical process of agreement through calculations, but in the context of democracy, it's about group decision-making without hierarchy.

      "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which classic issues of the democratic process blockchain-based voting could solve. The options are A through D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the article's main points. The article discusses how blockchain technology, through distributed consensus, could address some democratic issues. It mentions things like transparency, security, and maybe efficiency.\n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA. Corruption of the physical voting process. The article talks about blockchain ensuring secure, transparent records. If the physical process is corrupt (like tampering with ballots), blockchain's immutable ledger could prevent that. So A might be a candidate.\n\nB. Authoritarian governments holding falsified elections. The article mentions that blockchain could make elections more trustworthy, but the example given was about the DAO being hacked, which is more about security than authoritarian control. However, the article does say that blockchain could make records permanent and verifiable, which might help prevent falsified elections. But the article also points out that blockchain isn't foolproof, like the DAO hack. But the question is about what it could solve, not necessarily all issues.\n\nC. Time constraints of the voting public. The article mentions that blockchain could allow people to participate from anywhere, maybe at their convenience. It talks about people who can't attend in-person assemblies due to work or family, so blockchain could let them vote anytime. That seems like it addresses time constraints. So C is another possible answer.\n\nD. Low public engagement. The article discusses how people are disengaged, but blockchain's ability to make participation easier might increase engagement. However, the article also says that the problem is more about trust in the system rather than just engagement. But the question is about solving classic issues. Low engagement is a problem, but the article's focus is more on transparency and security.\n\nThe article specifically mentions that blockchain could allow people to vote from their devices, which would help with time constraints (C). Also, the secure and transparent nature of blockchain would address corruption (A). But the question is which one is the correct answer.\n\nLooking back at the article's examples: the author talks about how blockchain could allow for more flexible voting times, so people can participate without being forced to be present. That would solve time constraints. Also, the secure records would prevent corruption. However, the question is about classic issues. The article's main points include solving issues like ensuring that votes are counted accurately (preventing corruption) and allowing more people to participate (time constraints). \n\nBut the answer options are single choice. The article says that blockchain could make the voting process more secure (A) and allow for more participation (C). However, the question is about which one is a classic issue. The classic issues include corruption, low engagement, etc. \n\nThe article mentions that the problem with current systems is that they can't handle crises, and that people feel betrayed by parties. The blockchain solution is about making the process more transparent and secure. So A and C are both possible. But the answer options are A, B, C, D. The original question is from the article, which says that blockchain could solve the problem of people being too exhausted to attend assemblies (time constraints), so C. Also, the article says that blockchain could prevent tampering (A). But the question is which one is the correct answer. \n\nLooking at the article's specific mention: \"we might be able to democratise democracy itself, in all sorts of salutary ways. We might fold in all those who, by dint of their work, childcare or family obligations, are too exhausted or pressed for time to attend a decision-making assembly...\" That directly points to time constraints (C). So the answer is C. But also, the article mentions that blockchain's transparency could prevent corruption (A). However, the question is which one is the correct answer. The options are A, B, C, D. The article says that blockchain could solve time constraints (C) and corruption (A). But the question is which one is the correct answer. The original question is from the article, and the answer is likely C. But I need to check the article again. \n\nWait, the article also says that blockchain could prevent the corruption of the physical process, as the blockchain is a permanent record. So A is also a possible answer. But the question is which one is the correct answer. The options are A, B, C, D. The answer could be both A and C, but since it's a single choice, which is more emphasized? The article says that the blockchain could allow people to vote from their devices, which would solve time constraints (C). Also, the article mentions that the blockchain's transparency would prevent corruption (A). However, the question is about classic issues. The classic issues include corruption (A) and time constraints (C). But the answer options are single choice. \n\nLooking back at the article's conclusion, the author says that blockchain-based systems could allow for more participation, which addresses time constraints.

Let me go through the key points.\n\nThe author mentions that blockchain systems have security flaws, like the DAO hack, which is option A. That's definitely a point made. Then, there's the issue of ownership. The author points out that Ethereum requires members to buy shares, which ties into property and ownership, which might be option B. Also, the author talks about the complexity of blockchain technology, making it hard for the general public to understand, which is option C. \n\nThe author also mentions that the blockchain's values (like private property) are inimical to the principles of the commons, which relates to B. Additionally, the author notes that the blockchain's complexity could lead to abuse, which ties into C. \n\nSo, all three options A, B, and C are issues the author points out.

The options are A to D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points from the article. The author discusses blockchain and distributed consensus as potential solutions for digital democracy. However, there are several challenges mentioned. \n\nIn the part where the author talks about the digital divide, they mention that not everyone owns a smartphone, and even over 60% of North Americans don't. This points towards D: Ownership of adequate digital devices. The author also talks about the digital divide being a problem for technologists who might not consider it. \n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that blockchain-based systems might not be accessible to everyone because of the need for devices. The article also discusses the challenges of implementing such systems, including the digital divide. \n\nOther options: A is security, but the article does mention security in the context of blockchain being vulnerable to hacks, but that's not the main barrier. B is power consumption, which wasn't discussed much. C is technological literacy, but the article focuses more on access to devices rather than people's understanding of technology. \n\nSo the main barrier highlighted is the ownership of digital devices, which is option D.\n</think>\n\nD"

The options are A to D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the main points of the article. The author discusses how traditional democracy is failing, leading to populist and authoritarian movements. They mention blockchain and distributed consensus as a possible solution. The article talks about how blockchain-based systems could allow for more direct, decentralized decision-making, using technology to create new forms of democracy. However, the author also points out some problems with these systems, like the emphasis on property and ownership, and the potential for them to be flawed.\n\nThe question is about the author's proposed solution. The options are: A) Embracing blockchain as is, B) Classical methods, C) New framework, D) Educating the public.\n\nThe author does suggest that blockchain-based systems could be a solution, but they also criticize them for certain issues. However, the main argument is that there's a need for a new kind of democracy, which the blockchain technology might enable. The author mentions that the current systems are not sufficient and that a new framework based on blockchain could be the way forward, even though there are challenges. So, the answer might be C. But wait, the author also says that the blockchain-based solutions have their own problems, so maybe the answer is not A. The author isn't just saying to use blockchain as is, but to create a new framework that addresses the issues. The article ends with the idea that maybe we can learn from blockchain and create a better system. So, the correct answer is C: Creating a brand new framework for collective decision-making.\n</think>\n\nC"

      "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking what the author sees as an integral aspect of an anarchist viewpoint based on the provided text.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points from the article. The author discusses blockchain-based distributed consensus and how it's being promoted by some as a new form of democracy. However, the author also points out that there's a misunderstanding between the technical term \"distributed consensus\" and the anarchist vision it's supposed to represent.\n\nThe question is about an anarchist viewpoint. The options are A to D. Let's look at each option in the context of the article.\n\nOption A: The ability to remove voting members at will. The article mentions that Ethereum democracies have owners who can add or remove voting members. The author criticizes this because it's not aligned with the idea of political participation as a right. So this seems like a point against it, not an integral aspect of anarchism.\n\nOption B: Lack of state or national delegation. The article talks about a vision where power is distributed across non-hierarchical assemblies not sanctioned by the state. Anarchism typically opposes state authority, so this might be a candidate. But the author is critical of the blockchain systems because they still involve ownership and private property, which might not fit purely anarchist principles.\n\nOption C: A desire for a peer-to-peer networked democracy. The author mentions that some see blockchain as a way to create a networked democracy, but the author is critical of the technical aspects. However, the anarchist vision in the text is about a federation of non-hierarchical assemblies, which could align with peer-to-peer. But the author points out that the term \"distributed consensus\" is misunderstood.\n\nOption D: Embracing distributed consensus created by blockchain. The author argues that the term \"distributed consensus\" is being misused. The technical process is about computational agreement, not the anarchist vision of a decentralized, stateless society. The author is critical of this, so maybe this isn't the correct answer.\n\nThe article says that the anarchist vision is about a federation of non-hierarchical assemblies unsanctioned by any state. The author mentions that people are excited about blockchain because it offers a radical, classically anarchist vision. However, the author also points out that the technical term \"distributed consensus\" is different from that vision. The key point is that the anarchist viewpoint would be a peer-to-peer networked democracy (C) without state involvement, but the author is critical of the blockchain systems because they involve ownership and property. However, the question is about what the author sees as an integral aspect of an anarchist viewpoint. The text says that the anarchist vision is a federation of non-hierarchical assemblies, which is a peer-to-peer network. So the answer might be C. But the author also mentions that the blockchain's distributed consensus is a misunderstanding. However, the question is about the author's view of an anarchist viewpoint, not the blockchain's. The author says that the anarchist vision is about a networked democracy without state sanction, so C is correct. Alternatively, B is about lack of state delegation, which is part of anarchism. But the article's anarchist vision is more about peer-to-peer, so C. Wait, the answer might be C. The author says that the blockchain-based systems are being seen as a way to achieve a radical, classically anarchist vision of a world with non-hierarchical assemblies. So the integral aspect would be a peer-to-peer networked democracy (C). The answer is C.\n</think>\n\nC"

The user is asking which option fits the theme.\n\nThe article starts by talking about the problems with current democracy and how blockchains offer a new approach. It mentions that while there's enthusiasm for distributed consensus, there's also a misunderstanding. The author points out that blockchains aren't perfect\u2014they have issues like the DAO hack, and they're based on property rights which might conflict with democratic principles. But the article also acknowledges that they could be useful if implemented correctly, avoiding some of the flaws of traditional systems.\n\nLooking at the options: A says blockchains don't work now. The article does mention problems, but also potential. B says they could be a tool if used properly. C is none, but the article does discuss possibilities. D says they're the future. The article is cautious, pointing out both potential and flaws. The conclusion is that they might be worth exploring but need to be designed properly.

The author starts by discussing the decline of representative democracy and the rise of authoritarian tendencies. Then they introduce blockchain-based systems like Ethereum and Backfeed as potential solutions. The author acknowledges the appeal of these systems for their decentralized, participatory nature. However, the author also points out several issues: misunderstandings of the technology, the role of property and ownership, the vulnerability to hacking (like the DAO incident), and the digital divide.\n\nThe author is critical of the blockchain approach because they see it as not truly aligning with democratic values.

They acknowledge that it's a problem but not that it's a complete failure.\n\nB. No, it is a system vulnerable to hacking. The author does mention vulnerabilities, but the main argument isn't just about hacking. The author is more critical of the underlying values and structure.\n\nC. Yes, this is the path to give representation back to the people. The author initially presents the idea as hopeful but then critiques it. The answer might not be C because the author is skeptical.\n\nD. Yes, but the technology needs improvement. The author does say that there are problems with the current systems, but they also think there's potential.

The author points out that people often mix up the idea of consensus as a common purpose among people (like in a political context) with the technical process of computers agreeing on a transaction's validity. This is a critical misunderstanding because the technical consensus is about computational validation, not human agreement. \n\nLooking at the options, option A says it's about the political versus technical context of distributed consensus.

They mention that some people are turning to authoritarian leaders because they feel the system isn't working. The author also talks about blockchain-based systems as a potential solution for more democratic processes, but points out that these systems have their own issues, like the emphasis on ownership and the potential for corruption.\n\nThe question is about what happens if democracy doesn't evolve. The author seems critical of the current state of democracy and suggests that the current systems are failing. They mention that people are disillusioned and might support authoritarian figures.

It also talks about how these systems could let people participate from anywhere, which could include those who are too busy or have other commitments. \n\nThe article also mentions that the current examples of blockchain tech are tied to private property and ownership, which might not align with the principles of the commons. However, the potential benefits include allowing more people to participate in decisions, even if they can't attend in person. \n\nLooking at the options, the 40% without smartphones (A) might struggle with access to such a system, which is digital. Busy voters (B) could benefit because they might not have time to attend physical meetings. The article does mention that people with work, childcare, or family obligations are too exhausted to attend assemblies, so a digital system could help them participate. \n\nSilicon Valley (C) is where the blockchain tech is developed, but the question is about who benefits from the process, not the developers. Politicians (D) might not benefit as the system is supposed to be more democratic and less controlled by traditional politicians. \n\nSo the answer is likely B. Busy voters, as the article points out that they can't attend in person but could use a digital system to participate. However, the article also mentions that the system might not be accessible to everyone due to the digital divide, but the question is about who benefits most. The answer might be B.\n</think>\n\nB"

      "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which area of the voting process would be most improved by blockchain democracy. The options are large-scale legislation, daily civic participation, presidential votes, or the article is unclear.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the main points of the article. The article discusses how blockchain technology, through distributed consensus, could revolutionize democracy. It mentions things like participatory budgeting, allowing people to participate in decisions beyond just elections. It talks about how blockchain could make voting more transparent, secure, and maybe more accessible. \n\nThe article also points out that current democratic systems have issues with handling crises and failing to meet the needs of the people. Blockchain is proposed as a way to create more direct and decentralized forms of decision-making. \n\nLooking at the options, large-scale legislation (B) is about major laws passed by governments. Daily civic participation (C) refers to regular involvement in community decisions, like local issues. The article mentions examples like Porto Alegre-style participatory budgeting, which is a form of daily civic participation. \n\nThe article also talks about how blockchain allows for more flexible and scalable decision-making processes, not just for major legislation but for smaller, ongoing decisions. It suggests that blockchain could enable more frequent and inclusive participation, which would be part of daily civic life. \n\nThe article also mentions that blockchain-based systems could allow for more immediate and transparent decisions, which might improve daily participation. The part about the DAO being hacked shows that while there are risks, the technology is being explored for various levels of decision-making. \n\nSo, the answer is likely C. Daily civic participation. The article emphasizes that blockchain could enable more direct and frequent participation in decisions, not just in major elections but in everyday community matters.\n</think>\n\nC"

      "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author thinks Brexit was a good thing. The options are A, B, C, or D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relevant parts of the article. The article discusses the decline of representative democracy and the rise of movements like Brexit, Trump, etc. The author mentions that these events show people's frustration with democracy not representing their interests. \n\nIn the section where the author talks about the problems with current democracy, they mention Brexit as an example. The author says that the conventional practice of democracy has failed people, leading to these movements. The author also references Brexit in the context of voters feeling that the system doesn't serve them, which is part of the broader critique of democracy.\n\nThe author then contrasts this with the idea of distributed consensus as a potential solution. However, the author doesn't explicitly say whether Brexit was good or bad. Instead, they present it as an example of democracy's failure. The author's main point is that the existing democratic systems aren't working, leading people to support leaders who promise to change things. \n\nLooking at the options, the author is critical of the current system, implying that Brexit was a result of democracy's shortcomings. So the answer would be B: No, it showed a weakness of democracy. The article doesn't say it was a good thing, but rather points out the failure of the system. The answer isn't D because the article does mention Brexit in the context of democracy's weaknesses.\n</think>\n\nB"
