The Martian leader told Tate that Kal-Jmar contains a catalyzing agent that could transform Mars into a planet with a Terrestrially-thick atmosphere.\n3. However, this revelation is not the reason for Tate's dejection.\n4. The Martian leader then explained that the Kal-Jmar Martians were not a separate species from the present-day Martians, but rather a degenerate branch that had chosen to remain static.\n5. Tate's dejection seems to stem from the revelation that the Kal-Jmar Martians were not superior to the present-day Martians, as he had previously assumed.\n\nBased on this analysis, it is likely that Tate was dejected because he learned that the Kal-Jmar Martians, whom he had idealized, were actually degenerate and inferior.\n\n**B**"

He is on Mars to reach the city of Kal-Jmar, where he hopes to acquire a spaceman's identity card.\n3. He kills a man to obtain the identity card, which implies he is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve his goals.\n4. He teams up with Harold Tate, a physicist who has discovered a way to break down the Kal-Jmar dome.\n5. Tate reveals that he wants to go to Kal-Jmar to explore its secrets, including a catalyzing agent that could transform Mars' atmosphere.\n6. Syme is interested in this discovery and is willing to help Tate, but his primary goal remains escaping from the Martian authorities.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems unlikely that Syme intends to reunite with his family (B) or exact revenge (C), as there is no indication of a family or past grievances. Syme's primary focus is on escaping and exploiting the situation for his own gain.\n\nThe most plausible option is (D) Exploit the atmosphere catalyst the Martians invented, as this aligns with his interest in the discovery and his willingness to help Tate.\n\n**D**"

Tate is a physicist who has discovered a way to break down the force field of Kal-Jmar, an ancient Martian city.\n3. Tate approaches Syme with a proposal to go to Kal-Jmar together, and Syme is intrigued by the prospect of treasure and adventure.\n4. Syme agrees to help Tate, but his primary motivation is not necessarily friendship or a desire to escape the law together.\n5.

This is mentioned in the text as \"a tendency of the Terrestrial mind is to ignore the obvious. We have not had a spoken language of our own for several thousand years.\" It implies that they have a unique ability to sense the thoughts or presence of outsiders, which is not explicitly stated as radar, patrolling on foot, or sensing rumbling from their underground caves.\n\nHowever, based on the given options, I would guess that the Martians detect Syme and Tate through a telepathic or telepathic-like ability, which is hinted at in the text.

It is mentioned that there is air in the cavern where the Martians live, but it's not clear if this is the entire city of Kal-Jmar or just this specific cavern.\n3. The text doesn't mention anything about Kal-Jmar being a gas planet.\n4. The text does mention that Earthlings who spoke terrestrial language were not allowed near Kal-Jmar, but it doesn't say that they lived there.\n\nConsidering these points, the correct answer is not clearly supported by the text, but I can make an educated guess.\n\nThe text does mention that Kal-Jmar's dome is a tenuous, globular field of force that defies analysis and explosives, which is a unique property of Kal-Jmar.\n\nSo, I'm going to take a guess that the special property of Kal-Jmar is related to its dome.
