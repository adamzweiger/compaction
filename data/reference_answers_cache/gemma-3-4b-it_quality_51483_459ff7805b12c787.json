Then I think I\u2019ll see somebody.\u201d He then clarifies, \u201cJust somebody.\u201d This suggests a desire for casual observation of human life and interaction, rather than a specific individual.\n\nConsidering the options:\n\n*   A. no one - he wants to sit alone in a room over Times Square - This is too extreme; the text indicates he wants to *see* people.\n*   B. his wife - The text mentions he has a girlfriend, \u201cGinny,\u201d but doesn\u2019t confirm it\u2019s his wife.\n*   C. Ginny - The text refers to her as \u201cGinny,\u201d strongly suggesting she is the woman he desires to see.\n*   D. his mother - There is no mention of a mother in the text.\n\nTherefore, the most logical answer is that he wants to see \u201cjust somebody,\u201d and the passage strongly implies that \u201csomebody\u201d is Ginny.\n\nC"

The passage repeatedly emphasizes Chapman\u2019s concern for the others\u2019 safety and his insistence on checking their equipment. He worries about \u201cone mistake\u201d and stresses the importance of checking suits and tanks. He doesn't seem concerned with money or status, and he explicitly states he doesn't want to stay. His actions suggest a protective, almost maternal, instinct \u2013 a desire to ensure their well-being, particularly given the dangerous environment. Option A (not wanting them to join Dixon) is a tangential reason and doesn\u2019t fully explain the constant inspections. Option B (going crazy) is a possible symptom of isolation, but doesn\u2019t account for his deliberate and consistent actions. Option C (assigned duty) is plausible but less compelling than the underlying motivation.

The text also mentions that they thought he'd be glad to stay for another year and a half or three years.

Chapman specifically mentions wanting to go to Venus but then declines, citing his desire to return to familiar comforts on Earth.

Furthermore, the text mentions \u201cbig plans for the station\u201d involving expanding the facility and increasing the number of personnel. This expansion implies a sustained scientific operation, not merely a temporary stopover. The reference to \u201cscientific experiments\u201d and \u201claboratories\u201d reinforces this idea.
