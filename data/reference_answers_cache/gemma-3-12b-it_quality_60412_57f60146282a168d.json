While descriptive, it wasn't an earned title for Earth itself.\n*   **Option D:** The text explicitly states Hospital Earth came into being *with* the formalization of the first Medical Service Contract with Deneb III. This signifies the earning of the \"Hospital Earth\" title.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nD"

However, Jenkins is described as a surgeon at one point. Stone is a surgeon as well.\n\nB."

The pills were \"white,\" and the text does not suggest it was a placebo.
