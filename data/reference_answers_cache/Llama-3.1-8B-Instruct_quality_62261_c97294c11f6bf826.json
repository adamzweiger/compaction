Splinter is described as a probationary pilot, indicating that he is a young and inexperienced space traveler.\n2. Kerry is an older, veteran space traveler who has a reputation as a trouble shooter.\n3. The text describes Kerry as having taken Splinter under his wing, giving him the benefits of his experience.\n4. Kerry is portrayed as a mentor figure to Splinter, offering advice and guidance.\n5. The dialogue between the two characters suggests a friendly and teasing relationship, with Kerry often joking with Splinter and Splinter responding with good-natured humor.\n\nBased on these points, I would guess that:\n\nD"

Kerry Blane experiences space bends and receives a hypodermic and several capsules from Splinter to alleviate his symptoms.\n2. After the crash, Kerry is injured and receives a splint for his broken arm from Splinter.\n3. Splinter also injures his leg in the crash, but the story does not mention any significant medical intervention for him beyond bandaging his leg.\n4. There is no mention of any medical intervention for the unnamed space warriors.\n\nConsidering these events, Kerry Blane receives medical intervention on two separate occasions, while Splinter receives medical intervention only once.\n\n**D**"

The text mentions that Kerry Blane and Splinter Wood are in the same ship, which suggests that it's not a single-person cruiser.\n2. The text describes the ship as a \"DX cruiser\", which implies that it's a larger, more advanced type of ship.\n3. The text mentions that the ship has a \"pilot room\" and \"air bunks\", which suggests that it's a ship with a crew or at least a small living quarters.\n4. The text also mentions that the ship has a \"vision port\" and a \"control panel\", which suggests that it's a ship with a cockpit or a control room.\n5. When the ship crashes, the text mentions that the two men are thrown forward and that the ship \"cartwheeled a dozen times in a few seconds\", which suggests that the ship is relatively small and lightweight.\n\nConsidering these points, the most likely answer is:\n\nB. It was relatively small, only large enough for two people"

It mentions that the ocean is home to a \"tremendous size of the growths\" which are described as \"fern-like\" trees.\n3. The islands are described as being like a \"turtle\" and are covered in \"heavy fern-like growth\".\n\nConsidering these points, the islands are not exposed continental plates (B) or volcanic mountains (C) because they are covered in dense jungle-like growths. They are not moons (D) because they are described as being part of the planet's surface.\n\nTherefore, the most likely description of the islands of Venus is that they are floating pads covered in jungle.\n\n**A**"

This excitement is evident when Splinter says, \"Hot damn! Now we'll see a little action!\" and \"Listen, for ten minutes of that, I'd ride this chunk of metal for a year!\"\n4.
