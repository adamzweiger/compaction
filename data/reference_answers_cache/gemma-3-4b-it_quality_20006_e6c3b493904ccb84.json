This isn't simply about belated discovery; it\u2019s about *knowing* and remaining silent.\n3. **Recalibration of moral judgment:** The piece calls for a \u201cmoral recalibration,\u201d suggesting people aren\u2019t being judged fairly \u2013 particularly those who enabled Clinton\u2019s behavior.\n4. **Focus on enablement:** The core of the argument isn't about outright wrongdoing but about *allowing* or *enabling* Clinton\u2019s behavior. People like Currie, Stephanopoulos, and others are criticized because they didn\u2019t actively oppose his actions, even when they knew about them.\n5. **Lack of principled action:** Many of the individuals mentioned didn\u2019t resign or loudly protest, suggesting a lack of moral conviction.\n\nConsidering this, the best answer is:\n\nA. Even though they did not seem to be directly involved or cause problems because they did not quit their jobs on principle, they were at fault.\n\nA"

Finally, they mention that the public's fascination with the scandal led to harm being done to innocent people (Monica Lewinsky).\n\nTherefore, the author does believe the public bears some responsibility.\n\nD"

Stephanopoulos is specifically called \"smacking of hypocrisy\" for belatedly discovering Clinton\u2019s behavior.\n3. **Nuanced Scoring:** The scorecard itself demonstrates this nuance. Linda Tripp receives a negative rating, but the article notes she risked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong. Bruce Lindsey is rated \u201capprox -5\u201d because there's insufficient information to judge his loyalty accurately. Vernon Jordan gets a +3 rating, acknowledging potential awareness but framing it as a charitable interpretation.\n4. **Focus on Context:** The article repeatedly emphasizes that loyalty isn't inherently good, and it can be opportunistic. It highlights how figures like Morris and Stephanopoulos benefited personally from exposing Clinton's behavior.\n\nConsidering all these points, it's clear that Slate doesn\u2019t offer a simple \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d assessment of loyalty. Instead, they analyze it within the specific context of each individual's actions and motivations.\n\nD"

It explicitly states it's \"not, of course, an exact science\" and questions how to judge Ann Lewis.\n4. **Targeting Clinton:** While Clinton is certainly central, the article isn\u2019t primarily focused on proving he was *disproportionately* shamed.
