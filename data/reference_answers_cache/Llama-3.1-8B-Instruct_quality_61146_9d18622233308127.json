Hoshick is described as a Flap-jack who is interested in sports and games, particularly those involving skirmishforms.\n2. Initially, Hoshick sees the humans as \"sportsmen like ourselves\" and is eager to engage in a contest with them.\n3. However, when Retief proposes a more civilized approach, Hoshick is receptive to the idea and seems to be looking for an alternative to war.\n4. When Retief suggests that they settle their differences through farming competition, Hoshick is enthusiastic and agrees to the proposal.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that Hoshick is not fond of war and is open to alternative solutions. This suggests that he would rather watch than take part in battle.\n\n**D**"

When Retief arrived on Adobe, he left the ship on a skiff with only a pistol, without opening the sealed packet of orders.\n4.

Later, Retief wrestles Hoshick, the leader of the Flapjacks, and uses the same technique to subdue him.\n4.
