It is mentioned that the Venusian was already on the move after shooting Johnny, and that Bo had seen the Venusian arguing with Johnny at the bar. Later, it is revealed that the Guards office reported being unable to find the murderer, and that the Venusian seemed to have vanished completely. This suggests that the Venusian is the one who killed Johnny and is now coming to kill Bo.\n\n \nB"

This is supported by the fact that the Venusian said \"\u2014my girl, dammit\" and \"Like hell I am!\" when the girl denied being his. \n\nThe killer's actions and the context suggest that he was trying to kill Bo because he was a witness to the murder of Johnny, which was likely a crime of passion related to the dispute over the girl.\n\nThe correct answer is D."

While Bo did say \"I don't want to laugh too, but checked himself for fear he wouldn't be able to stop\", it is not mentioned that he loved to learn, but rather that he wanted to learn.\n\nBased on the information provided, Bo was unusual compared to his colleagues because he was larger and heavier than most spacemen.\n\nD"

The story mentions a \"rowdy bar\" where the main character, Bo Jonsson, and Johnny Malone go for a final spree before checkoff and departure.

Lundgard was on the ship \"Drake\" when it came to Achilles to pick up a cargo of refined thorium for Earth.\n2. The \"Drake\" had lost some reaction-mass water from a cracked gasket, which made it economically unfeasible to carry Lundgard back to Earth.\n3. Lundgard volunteered to stay behind, suggesting the idea of leaving him on Achilles, as the mass of the ship would be reduced, making the trip home less expensive.\n\nBased on this information, the reason Lundgard did not ride home on his original ship is that he was left behind due to the economic reasons related to the ship's mass.\n\n**C**"
