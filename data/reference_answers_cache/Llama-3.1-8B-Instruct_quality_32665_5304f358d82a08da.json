The scouter, piloted by Gibson, arrived and rescued Farrell, leaving the squid behind.\n3. The squid were waiting on the outcrop, which suggests they were waiting for the Arzian native, not the Earthmen.\n4. The Earthmen left Arz in the Marco Four, indicating they would not be returning to the planet.\n\nConsidering these points, it's likely that the squid would continue their association with the Arzian natives, as they seem to be part of a larger ecosystem and hunting pattern.\n\n**B**"

The crew's reaction to Farrell's actions is more related to his decision to investigate the Arzians without permission rather than a threat of leaving him (B).\n4.

Arthur is described as having a \"vague sense of something overlooked\" and a \"vague sense of something\" later on, indicating that he is not necessarily a genius, but rather someone who might be a bit careless or not fully paying attention.\n\n2. He decides to sneak out of the ship to investigate the Arzians, which is a breach of Terran Regulations. This suggests that he is willing to take risks and act impulsively.\n\n3. He becomes disoriented and panicked when he finds himself paralyzed on the islet, showing that he can be impulsive and prone to panic.\n\n4.

This is likely a chemical or biological agent used by the Arzians or the octopods.\n\nC. Ships that can submerge to examine deep waters: The story mentions the scouter, which is a ship that can submerge to examine deep waters. This option is used in the story.\n\nD. Tablets used to enhance rest: The story mentions Stryker mixing a tablet into his nightcap, which is likely a sleep aid or sedative.\n\nConsidering the options, I'm going to take a guess that option D is the one that is not used in the story in the context of enhancing rest or sleep.

They were puzzled by this behavior and the fact that the Arzians didn't seem to be able to swim.\n\nAs they investigated further, they discovered that the Arzians were not the dominant species on the planet, but rather the squids were, and the Arzians were being used as bait for the flying lizards, which were the \"game\" hunted by the squids.\n\nThey realized that their initial understanding of the situation was incorrect and that they were not dealing with a simple ecosystem, but rather a complex one where the Arzians were being used as prey by the dominant species.\n\nThey decided to leave the planet, as colonization was no longer an option due to the fact that they would be interfering with an established and complex ecosystem.\n\nThe characters learned what they wanted to learn, which was the truth about the Arzians and the ecosystem on the planet, and they made the decision to leave the planet based on what they learned.\n\n \n\nC."

Arthur's decision to investigate without Stryker's permission shows that he's becoming increasingly restless and curious about the Arzians and their customs.\n2. This action allows Arthur to discover the Arzians' unique behavior of being anesthetized and taken to the islet, which is a crucial plot point in understanding the planet's ecosystem.\n3. The exploration also puts Arthur in harm's way, creating tension and suspense as he's caught by the Arzians and left paralyzed on the islet.\n4. The subsequent rescue by Gibson and the revelation of the city's existence under the ocean raises more questions and deepens the mystery, keeping the reader engaged.\n\n**D**"

Gibson is indeed independent and has a tendency to act alone, which might make him less fun to be on an expedition with, as it could lead to a lack of teamwork and coordination.\n\nB. Farrell's lack of thorough thinking does pose a risk, but it's not necessarily a reason to avoid him on an expedition. He's a useful crew member and seems to be willing to learn.\n\nC. Stryker's rudeness is a concern, but it's not the most significant issue. He's the captain, and his experience and knowledge are valuable assets.\n\nD. Gibson's know-it-all personality is indeed frustrating, but it's not the most significant concern. His knowledge often proves to be correct, and his stubbornness can be a strength in certain situations.\n\nConsidering these points, I think the least enjoyable person to go on an expedition with would be A.

The crew of the Marco Four is already on the planet, and the story revolves around their interactions with the native species.\n2. The story has a mystery element, with the crew trying to understand the behavior of the Arzian natives and the city on the ocean floor. However, the reveal of the city and the true nature of the Arzian natives is not a surprise, but rather a gradual understanding of the planet's ecosystem.\n3. Interspecies communication is a significant aspect of the story, but it's not the primary focus. The crew is more concerned with understanding the behavior of the Arzians and the squids, rather than communicating with them directly.\n4. Winged lizards are a part of the planet's ecosystem, but they are not the central element of the story. They are more of a plot device to illustrate the Arzians' behavior.\n\nConsidering these points, the story seems to be more focused on the mystery and the science fiction elements of the planet's ecosystem, rather than space travel, interspecies communication, or fantasy creatures like winged lizards.\n\n**B**"
