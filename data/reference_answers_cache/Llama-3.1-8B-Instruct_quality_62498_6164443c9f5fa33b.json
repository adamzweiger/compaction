Bobby is described as \"fidgeting\" and \"muttering\" when he's observing the S.S.P. man, indicating that he's restless and possibly anxious.\n2. Pop is described as standing straight and firm, suggesting confidence and composure.\n3. Bobby is eager to push the button to start the ship, which implies that he's excited about the journey.\n4. Pop is more serious and cautious, as evident from his conversation with Martha (Mom) about the uncertainty of their new life on Eros.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that Bobby's attitude towards flying the spaceship is more enthusiastic and adventurous, while Pop's is more serious and cautious.\n\n**C**"

He expresses concerns about the uncertainty of their new life on Eros and the possibility of it not being fair to his family.\n3. He mentions that the world they have known and loved lies behind them, implying that he is leaving behind a life they were familiar with.\n4. When his wife, Martha, asks if he wants to go on, he nods, but his expression and words suggest that he is still uncertain.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that Pop is not upset because he thinks the mission will fail (B), nor because the family was forced to leave Earth (C). He also doesn't seem to be feeling selfish (A). The most likely reason for his unease is that he knows moving to Eros is not the best decision for the family (D).\n\n**D**"

Dick is described as a skilled and capable individual, who can handle complex tasks and take charge when needed.\n3. Bobby, on the other hand, is described as a 15-year-old boy who is eager to help but also prone to impatience and disobedience.\n4. Pop seems to trust Dick more with important tasks, such as handling the spaceship's controls and making decisions.\n5. Pop's trust in Dick is not necessarily due to physical fitness, as there is no mention of Dick being more physically fit than Bobby.\n6. While Bobby does make some mistakes, such as pressing the button too early during takeoff, Pop does not seem to hold this against him.\n7. However, Bobby's impatience and disobedience, such as his refusal to follow Dick's orders, suggest that he may not be as mature or cooperative as Dick.\n\nBased on these points, the most likely reason why Pop prefers Dick's help with the spaceship is that Dick is more mature and takes the journey seriously, unlike Bobby.\n\n**B**"

They had been preparing to leave the safety of their spaceship and start a new life on Eros, but their ship sank, and they had to abandon it quickly. They were worried about losing their supplies because they wouldn't have access to them once they were outside the ship.\n\nThey were not aware of the environment on Eros being hostile and deadly (B) or that nothing on Eros is usable or edible (A). The text actually suggests that Eros has atmosphere, water, and vegetable life, which implies that it might be habitable.\n\nThey also didn't mention wasting money on supplies (D), but rather that the supplies were ruined when the ship sank.\n\nTherefore, the main reason they were worried about losing their supplies was that they wouldn't have the necessary resources to survive the first few days on Eros (C).\n\nC"

This would have given them a sense of security and confidence in their ability to survive on the planet.\n\nThe family's attitude would have been more positive, and they would have been more focused on exploring and settling down on Eros, rather than struggling to find food and shelter. They would have been able to start their new life on the planet with a more optimistic outlook.\n\nThe family would have been more confident in their survival, and they would have been able to focus on building their new home and community without the immediate stress of finding food and supplies.\n\n**C**"

We know that Pop is a research physicist, which could imply a sedentary job that might affect his posture.\n2. There is no mention of him carrying a large item, so option B is unlikely.\n3. There is no mention of him standing in line all day, so option D is also unlikely.\n4. The text does mention that Pop's posture is compared to the S.S.P. man, who is described as standing straight and broad-shouldered.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely reason for Pop's poor posture is that it only appeared so compared to the S.S.P. man.\n\n**A**"

The text also mentions \"Eleanor cradled The Pooch closer to her\" in the context of trying to calm it down due to the thunderous blast of rocket motors, indicating that The Pooch is likely an animal that gets scared easily.\n3. The name \"The Pooch\" is colloquial and informal, often used to refer to a dog.\n\nConsidering these points, it is reasonable to conclude that The Pooch is a dog.\n\nA."

However, it is not explicitly stated that he fixed the ship to make it fully operational.\n\nThe General Spacecraft Cradles are mentioned as the facility where the Moseleys' ship would take off, but there is no indication that the Cuchulainn received any special protection from the General Spacecraft Cradles during its journey.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that the most likely answer is that Dick fixed the ship to make it operational, as he is a skilled rocketeer and has experience working on the ship.\n\nD."

She then quickly changes the subject, asking about food, which implies that she is more interested in practical matters than in Pop's concerns.\n3.

He mentions that there are no more Earthly frontiers for humans to dare, but there's a deep, instinctive longing to hew a new home from virgin land.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that Pop's vision is not just about wealth or a small settlement, but about creating a new home and community.\n\nA.
