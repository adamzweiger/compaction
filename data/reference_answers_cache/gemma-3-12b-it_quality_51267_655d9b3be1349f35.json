My right leg was numb, but reasonably comfortable, clamped tight in a walking brace.\" This implies someone else applied the brace.\n\nNow let's look at the options:\nA. The med people - This is a strong possibility, as he mentions the \"Med people\" would be dealing with his injuries.\nB. He did it himself - The text indicates he was severely injured and couldn't have easily applied a brace.\nC. A colonel - There's no mention of a colonel applying the brace.\nD. The first aid cabinet - The cabinet provided supplies, but didn't physically treat him.\n\nTherefore, the most logical answer is that the medical personnel (\"Med people\") put his leg in a brace.\n\nA"

He needed to stay out and fight the war:** The text doesn't suggest he was needed for combat. It indicates he was being prevented from returning.\n*   **B. He was injured very badly:** While he was severely injured, the text states Kayle's primary concern wasn't his physical state, but something else.\n*   **C. They were afraid he was being controlled by someone:** The text explicitly mentions Kayle's suspicion that Granthan might have been subverted by the Gool through telehypnotic abilities or some other form of mental control. This is the core reason for their hesitation.\n*   **D. He was the only survivor of the disaster:** While true, being the sole survivor doesn't inherently explain why they'd prevent his return; it simply highlights his unusual situation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is C.\n\nC"

They ate iron:** The passage explicitly states they fed on \"potassium, calcium, iron and all the metals.\" So, they *did* eat iron.\n*   **B. They were large:** The passage describes them as \"monstrous shape\" and refers to a \"ton of liver writhing\", suggesting they were indeed large.\n*   **C. Their mouths were above their brains:** The passage doesn\u2019t mention the position of their mouths. This is not described or implied.\n*   **D. They lived all throughout the galaxy:** The passage only mentions them having a \"trans-Plutonian orbit\" and a single world. It does not state that they lived throughout the galaxy.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that is not true is that they lived all throughout the galaxy.\n\nD"

Because he was the only survivor: The text implies he *thought* he was the only survivor initially, but it wasn't the driving factor behind getting into the lifeboat.\nD. To go back to Earth to cause damage: This is a conclusion reached later in the story, not his initial motivation.\n\nTherefore, the primary reason Granthan entered the lifeboat was to escape the fire.\n\nA"

The authorities had circulated his picture: The text implies Kayle considers Granthan a threat and wants him contained, but it doesn't explicitly state his picture has been circulated. This is possible, but not directly confirmed.\n\nB. He could no longer control their minds: Initially, Granthan used his abilities to influence people (the fishing boat owner, the trainman, the cab driver). However, as he continued, he found it increasingly difficult to do so. This is a crucial detail in the story.\n\nC. He was injured: While Granthan is severely injured (broken leg, burns, skull fracture), this primarily affects his mobility and discomfort, not specifically his ability to get help. It's a factor, but not the primary one.\n\nD. He did not understand people: The text doesn't suggest Granthan lacks understanding of people. In fact, his psychodynamicist training indicates the opposite.\n\nThe core issue is his diminishing ability to control others' minds, making it harder to get assistance.\n\nC"

His coveralls were tattered:** The text explicitly mentions the coveralls were \"tattered.\" This suggests a need for a change.\n*   **C. He was in New Orleans:** Being in New Orleans is a setting, not a reason for changing clothes.\n*   **D. He was trying to avoid detection:** While avoiding detection is a likely underlying goal, the passage directly points to the condition of his clothes as the immediate trigger.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and stated reason is that his coveralls were tattered.\n\nB"

Guns:** The text mentions a yard cop recognizing him and trying to shoot him with a revolver, making this a relevant threat.\n*   **C. His injuries:** Granthan is severely injured (broken leg, burns, fractured skull) which significantly hinders his movement and ability to evade danger. This is a major ongoing threat.\n*   **D. Starvation:** While he's hungry, starvation is not an immediate danger.\n\nComparing the options, his injuries and the yard cop's gun both pose threats.

The key phrase \"six weeks earlier\" refers to Granthan\u2019s initial mission, indicating a period significantly longer than hours, and the multiple events occurring after the initial disaster clearly show a time frame extending beyond a few hours.\n\nD"

There was no mistake:** The narrative explicitly states Peter exploited vulnerabilities and manipulated people to return, suggesting errors were involved.\n*   **B. The missile operator that miscalculated trajectory to Peter\u2019s ship:** The text mentions missiles being launched, but doesn't detail any miscalculation by an operator.\n*   **C. The mission\u2019s control programming which auto-routed him home in the escape pod:** There's no mention of any such programming in the story.\n*   **D. The operator of the security net around Earth:** This is the most accurate answer. The text describes Peter disabling/misdirecting various people (a DEW Line patrol, a planetary controller, and a radar man) to circumvent the Earth's defenses. The operator of the security net, by failing to maintain proper vigilance or being manipulated, allowed Peter to slip through.\n\nD"

He seems more focused on utilizing his knowledge and abilities.\n*   **B. Infiltrate military headquarters and report back to the Gool:** The entire narrative revolves around Peter proving he *isn't* under Gool control. He actively fights against them, so this is highly unlikely.\n*   **C. Cause harm to the people who chose to let him die for fear of his control by the Gool:** While he expresses frustration with Colonel Kayle, the text implies a larger plan and strategic thinking rather than simple revenge. He appears more interested in leveraging his situation.\n*   **D. Explain his discoveries:** The text explicitly mentions he intends to raid Delta National Laboratories and has \"information that can win the war.\" This suggests he aims to share his understanding of Gool technology (matter transmission) and potentially use it against them. The reference to a \"plan\" implies he has something to reveal or act upon.\n\nTherefore, option D aligns best with the information in the passage.\n\nD"

Furthermore, he copies the Gool's method of telepathic probing and transmission. This strongly supports the idea that he developed these abilities through training.\n*   **B. He is being controlled by the Gool:** While the Gool initially attempted to control him, he ultimately fights back and uses their techniques against them. He is not simply a puppet.\n*   **C. He is only imagining that he has telepathy since he has gone mad:** The narrative consistently portrays his actions as deliberate and strategic, not delusional. The technical details of his actions suggest a level of control and understanding that would be unlikely in a state of madness.\n*   **D. He has known his telepathy since childhood and that\u2019s why he went into psychodynamics:** There\u2019s no mention of prior telepathic abilities or that his choice of psychodynamics was related to this.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is A.\n\nA"
