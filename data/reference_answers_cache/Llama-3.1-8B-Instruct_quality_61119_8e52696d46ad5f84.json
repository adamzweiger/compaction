The Actuarvac is a new automatic brain that can analyze claims and determine whether they are legitimate or not.\n3. Madison's boss, McCain, introduces the Actuarvac as a tool that will simplify Madison's job and help him from \"flying off on wild-goose chases.\"\n4. However, Madison is skeptical of the Actuarvac, and when McCain says it will \"keep you from flying off on wild-goose chases,\" Madison responds with, \"I didn't bother to inform him that that was all my job had ever been.\"\n\nFrom this information, it can be inferred that Madison is skeptical of the Actuarvac because he feels that it will replace him or make his job redundant, which is option B.\n\n**B**"

Madison hires a Rolls-Royce, a luxury car known for its size and prestige.\n2. He mentions that he hasn't been able to get his legs into any other foreign car since he was 15, implying that he is quite tall.\n3. He also states that he has refused to enter an American model since they all sold out their birthrights as passenger cars and went over to the tractor-trailer combinations when he was a boy, which further suggests that he is a large man who requires a spacious vehicle.\n\nConsidering these points, the most logical conclusion is that Madison is a very tall man.\n\nC"

The article mentions that the insurance company, Manhattan-Universal, has been paying out a large number of claims from Granite City, which has raised suspicions.\n2. The claims are all legitimate, with eye-witness reports and authenticated circumstances, but the number of claims is disproportionately high compared to the population of the town.\n3. The town's economy relies heavily on insurance payments, with the locals paying their premiums before paying for groceries.\n4. The townspeople are reluctant to let Professor Parnell leave, suggesting that they might be hiding something.\n5. Professor Parnell claims that the people of Granite City are \"subhuman\" and lack psionic abilities due to the granite in the town, which seems to be a cover story for the true reason.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that the high number of claims is not due to the people being unusually accident-prone, but rather due to some underlying issue that the townspeople are hiding.\n\n \n\nA"

However, as Madison investigated, he found that the high accident rate was not due to false claims but rather the unique properties of the granite in the area, which was causing the residents to be accident-prone due to a lack of psionic abilities.\n\nThe residents of Granite City were not making false claims, but rather, their circumstances made them more prone to accidents. So, the Actuarvac's suspicion was incorrect.\n\nA."

He wants to stop the contamination caused by this granite to prevent the psionic sterility from affecting other people.\n\nBased on these points, it seems that Dr. Parnell is concerned that the granite from Granite City is spreading the psionic sterility to other places, which could potentially affect other people.\n\n**A**"

Madison is initially skeptical of Parnell's story, as evident from his response to Parnell's claim of psionic sterility: \"I don't know what to make of your story.\"\n2. He questions Parnell's expertise, mentioning that he is not a physicist or biologist, which implies he doesn't consider Parnell an authority on the topic.\n3. Madison also expresses doubt about the idea of psionic abilities and the concept of psionic sterility, which suggests he is not convinced by Parnell's explanation.\n4. He decides to help Parnell escape, but his actions are driven by a desire to get Parnell out of the situation, rather than a belief in Parnell's story.\n\nConsidering these points, Madison's attitude towards Parnell's story is one of skepticism and doubt, but he pretends to believe it for the time being to help Parnell escape.\n\nD"

However, without the professor's explanation, he might not have had a clear understanding of the underlying cause of the situation.\n\nHe might have continued to suspect that the people of Granite City were involved in a conspiracy, but he wouldn't have had a specific reason or explanation for their behavior. He might have continued to investigate the town, possibly uncovering more evidence of the conspiracy, but he wouldn't have had the crucial piece of information that Professor Parnell provided.\n\nWithout Professor Parnell's explanation, Madison's perception of Granite City would have been different in the sense that he wouldn't have had a clear understanding of the underlying cause of the situation. He might have continued to suspect that something was off, but he wouldn't have had a specific explanation for it.\n\nA"

The text mentions that Madison's boss, Thad McCain, has given him a rejected claim card with the notation \"Investigate the Ozark village of Granite City.\"\n2. Before heading to Granite City, Madison wants to gather more information about the village.\n3. He walks a few hundred feet down the hall and into the manual record files.\n4. He spends four hours flipping switches and looking at microfilm projections.\n\nConsidering these points, it is likely that Madison is trying to gather information about Granite City before visiting the village.\n\nThe answer is A."

The narrator, Madison, is investigating a high number of accident claims in Granite City.\n2. He researches the claims and finds that the town has a high accident rate compared to its production, suggesting that the accidents are not solely due to the quarry's operation.\n3. The narrator talks to the marshal, Thompson, who claims that the accidents are genuine and not faked.\n4. Madison meets with the professor, Parnell, who suggests that the people of Granite City are \"subhuman\" and lack psionic abilities due to the granite in the area.\n5. Parnell explains that the granite emits radioactive radiation that inhibits the genes that transmit psionic powers, making the townspeople psionically sterile.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible explanation for the proliferation of accidents in Granite City is related to the granite and its effects on the townspeople.\n\nA. Something about the granite creates an inability to predict when an accident may occur."

The people of Granite City are not concerned about tourism, as there is no mention of it being a factor in their decision.\n\nConsidering these points, the most likely reason the population of Granite City wants to keep their deficiency a secret is that they are scared of losing their livelihood, which is based on the granite industry. \n\nA"
