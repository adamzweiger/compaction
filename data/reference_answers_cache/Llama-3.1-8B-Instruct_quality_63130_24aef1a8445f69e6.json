There is no mention of any alien language being spoken on Saturn. \n\nGiven this information, I would guess that the language spoken on Saturn is English, as it is the most likely language to be used by humans in the Solar System.\n\n**B**"

Gus is mentioned to be engaged in a feud with the gang from sector Thirty-seven, specifically with a person named Bud Craney.\n2. Gus is upset that his injector was stolen and is seeking revenge.\n3. He mentions that he wants to \"yank Bud up by the roots\" and \"crucify\" him.\n4. The feud between the sectors is described as a long-standing one, with the men from sector Twenty-three and Thirty-seven fighting each other for years.\n\nConsidering these points, the reason for Gus's engagement in space fighting is related to his feud with Bud Craney and the gang from sector Thirty-seven, rather than any other option.\n\n \nB"

The passage mentions that the bugs can \"tromp\" a person, indicating they are small enough to walk on a person's body.\n2. It is mentioned that Gus Hamilton had to move out of his shack because the bugs were eating it \"right out from underneath his feet,\" implying that the bugs were crawling on the walls and floor.\n3. Gus mentions that the bugs are scared of wood and that he uses stilts made of wood to walk among them.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that the space bugs are small enough to walk on a person's body and can fit in small spaces, but not so small that they are microscopic. Based on this information, I would guess that they are about the size of a small beetle.\n\nD"

The passage mentions that the game will decide \"the supremacy of one of the two sectors\" and that the men are willing to \"fight it out\" in space. This suggests that the game is not just a friendly competition, but a high-stakes battle with serious consequences.\n\nHowever, the passage also mentions that Gus, the leader of sector Twenty-three, is considering using a pair of stilts to play the game, which could give him an advantage. Additionally, the passage describes the men as being \"willing to take a chance on getting killed\" and implies that they are not afraid of violence.\n\nGiven this information, it's difficult to predict the outcome of the game with certainty. However, based on the tone and description of the game, I would guess that the outcome will be violent and unpredictable.\n\nD."

Miss Perkins is a representative of the public health and welfare department of the Solar government.\n2. Her goal is to help the ring-rats (Gus and Bud) settle their feud through a more peaceful means.\n3. She suggests playing games as a way to redirect their rivalry into a less deadly and disturbing channel.\n4. Gus is initially hesitant, but eventually agrees to play space polo, which is a game he has read about in his papers.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that Miss Perkins' efforts were more about suggesting an idea (space polo) to Gus, rather than taking a direct action like mediation or posting signs. Her approach was to nudge Gus towards a more positive and peaceful path.\n\nSo, I'll take a guess:\n\nA\n\n**A**"

The presence of a repair shop and a mechanic implies that there is a need for repairs.\n3. The mechanic mentions that ships pull in with punctures due to Saturn's environment, which indicates that the environment poses a challenge to spaceships.\n4.

However, the story focuses more on the game of space polo and its introduction to the Ring's inhabitants, rather than the space travel itself.\n\nOption A, the sci-fi nerd who wants to learn more about the space travel of a character's universe, is less relevant because the story doesn't delve deeply into the technical aspects of space travel.\n\nOption D, the sci-fi nerd who loves to learn about the government operations/structures of a story, is also less relevant because the story doesn't focus on the government's operations or structures.\n\nOption C, the gaming nerd who loves to learn about new games they can play, is the most relevant because the story introduces a new game, space polo, and provides some context about how it's played.\n\nHowever, considering the overall tone and focus of the story, I think the most likely person to enjoy this story would be:\n\nB.
