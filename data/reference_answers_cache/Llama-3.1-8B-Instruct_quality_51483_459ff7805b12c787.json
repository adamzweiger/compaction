He also longed for the smell of cheap perfume and popcorn at a burlesque house and the sound of a rikky-tik piano. These feelings indicate that he was not fond of his life on the Moon. He also mentioned that the Moon's landscape was bleak and that he would be happy when he could see other faces.\n\nHe also had a sarcastic tone when talking about the Moon, calling it \"their little scientific home of tomorrow with none of the modern conveniences.\" This further suggests that he did not like his life on the Moon.\n\nAdditionally, when the relief ship arrived, he felt a sense of excitement and joy, which implies that he was eager to leave the Moon.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC"

There's no indication that he's gone crazy (B), as his actions seem rational and motivated by a desire to keep the others safe. \n\nConsidering his role as the pilot of the first ship and the fact that he's been in charge of the research station, it's likely that inspecting the equipment is part of his assigned duties (C). \n\nThe final option, (D), is also a possibility, as he does seem to be checking to see if they can take care of themselves, but it's not the most fitting reason given his background and responsibilities.\n\n**C**"
