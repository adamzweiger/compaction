This is a significant element, and the characters believe this connection might be the key to peace.\n*   **Option C:** Ravdin and Dana's relationship is important, but the passage frames it as a vehicle for a larger goal, not \"the link\" itself.\n*   **Option D:** The warp-passage is a method of travel, not a connection between people or cultures.\n\nThe passage suggests that the characters are trying to forge a link between their people and the Hunters, potentially based on shared understanding or empathy facilitated by the communal experience of the concerts. This aligns most closely with option B.\n\nA"

Fighting against the Hunters:** The society consistently avoids fighting the Hunters, preferring to flee. They see fighting as a path to destruction.\n*   **B. Finding a permanent hiding place from the Hunters:** While they do move from planet to planet, this is a recurring cycle of fleeing, not a focused goal of finding a *permanent* hiding place.\n*   **C. Having a perfect communal concert:** The concerts are a highly valued part of their culture, representing a pinnacle of artistic achievement and communal harmony. The passage emphasizes the significance of achieving this.\n*   **D. Electing a new leader:** Leadership isn't a central theme of the narrative.\n\nThe text emphasizes the importance of communal concerts as the ultimate goal and culmination of their cultural and artistic development.

They have offered messages of peace recently:** The text explicitly states the opposite - the people have been fleeing the Hunters for thousands of years.\n*   **B. It has been thousands of years since they have had contact:** The passage directly mentions \"thousands of years\" of fleeing and lack of contact. Ravdin argues that this long separation could mean the Hunters have changed.\n*   **C. He believes he can convince their leader:** While Ravdin is hopeful, the text doesn't state he *believes* he can convince the leader. It's more about a general hope for change.\n*   **D. He is going to try and trick the Hunters:** There's no indication of a trickery plan.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate reason for Ravdin's willingness to pursue peace is the long period of separation and the possibility that the Hunters have changed.\n\nB"

The concerts have gotten much longer in length:** The text doesn't focus on the duration of the concerts. This is not supported.\n*   **C. The concerts have become an event that involves the entire community:** The text explicitly states that the \"ultimate goal\" is the \"climactic expression of their heritage\" and refers to \"four hundred perfectly harmonized voices.\" It also mentions that \"everyone would be at the concert tonight.\" This indicates a high level of community involvement and significant artistic development.\n*   **D. The Hunters are starting to like the concerts even more:** The text implies the opposite, that the Hunters disdain the concerts.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate interpretation is that the concerts have evolved and become deeply integrated into the community, representing a pinnacle of artistic achievement.\n\nC"

That they will not achieve the perfect community concert:** This is a loss he laments, but it's secondary to the threat of the Hunters.\n*   **C. That Ravdin may be mistaken about the Hunters knowing their location:** He expresses concern about this, questioning Ravdin and emphasizing the certainty needed. This is a significant worry.\n*   **D. Ravdin and Dana\u2019s plan to stay behind and speak with the Hunters:** He explicitly pleads with them not to do this, recognizing the extreme danger it poses, and seems to consider it foolish and reckless.

He's weary and seems resigned to this pattern. He prioritizes the survival of his people above all else, even if it means abandoning their homes and culture.\n\n2. **Evaluate Each Option:**\n    * **A. Passive:** This aligns well with Nehmon's behavior \u2013 he allows events to unfold and reacts by fleeing, rather than taking proactive measures.\n    * **B. Resilient:** This suggests strength and the ability to bounce back from adversity. Nehmon's actions indicate a lack of resilience; he avoids conflict entirely.\n    * **C. Gentle:** While he's portrayed as somewhat sorrowful, \"gentle\" doesn't fully capture the essence of his leadership. It\u2019s more about avoiding confrontation than exhibiting gentleness.\n    * **D. Ineffective:** This is a suitable description, as his leadership consistently leads to the same outcome: flight and loss.\n\n3. **Identify the Odd One Out:** The word \"resilient\" directly contradicts the way Lord Nehmon is presented in the story. He demonstrates a distinct *lack* of resilience.\n\nD"

Burning the city achieves this by erasing their presence.\n\nOption A aligns perfectly with this logic: destroying evidence to mislead the Hunters.

He values duty and perpetuation of his people's military traditions. He is concerned with his people's glory through conquest. This aligns with a militaristic approach.\n*   **C. Democratic:** There is no indication of democratic principles in Frankle\u2019s leadership. He issues orders and expects obedience.\n*   **D.

However, he briefly experienced the music's effect, showing a flicker of doubt and emotion.\n*   **What was the outcome?** Ravdin and Dana were subjected to memory obliteration, leaving them essentially like animals in the jungle. However, the story states that Frankle \"had heard the music\" and that \"a tiny seed of doubt had been planted,\" suggesting a possibility of future change.\n\nConsidering these points:\n\n*   A is incorrect because the story doesn't state Hunters *never* change, just that they've been hostile for a long time.\n*   B is incorrect because Frankle did not declare peace; he ordered their torture.\n*   C is incorrect because while they *were* left in the jungle, the success or failure of their plan isn't solely dependent on their physical location.\n*   D is the most accurate.

While he ultimately rejects it, the story suggests art *can* influence even the most hardened individuals.\n\n*   **C. Hatred is stronger than benevolence.** The story portrays a history of fleeing from the Hunters due to fear and hatred. However, the ending hints that even hatred can be momentarily weakened by art.\n\n*   **D. It is better to flee than to fight.** This is a recurring action of Ravdin's people throughout history in the story, but the ending subtly challenges this, suggesting a possibility of confronting the Hunters.\n\nConsidering the narrative arc, option B best captures a central theme.\n\nB"
