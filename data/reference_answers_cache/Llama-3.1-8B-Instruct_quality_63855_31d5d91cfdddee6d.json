The term \"Aphrodisiac\" is used as an adjective to describe the ship, which implies that it is being used to describe the ship itself.\n2. In the text, the ship is referred to as the \"Old Aphrodisiac\" and \"Lover-Girl\", which suggests that the term \"Aphrodisiac\" is being used as a nickname for the ship.\n3. The ship is referred to as \"Old Aphrodisiac\" in the context of Commander Strykalski's conversation with Cob Whitley, when Cob says, \"Tethys, here comes Lover-Girl. It's going to be a long, long cruise, Captain.\" This implies that \"Aphrodisiac\" is being used as a nickname for the ship.\n\nBased on this information, the correct answer is:\n\nB"

The workers were welding appendages to the Cleopatra on the airless field next to the Experimental Substation on Tethys.\n2. The crew of the Cleopatra was watching in dismay, suggesting that they were not involved in the process.\n3. Ivy Hendricks mentioned that they were planning to make a hyper-ship out of the Cleopatra.\n4. The appendages were described as \"screen-like\" and were being welded to the bow and stern of the ship.\n\nConsidering these points, it's clear that the workers were preparing the Cleopatra for something related to the hyper-ship project, which is option B."

The message was addressed to Commander Strykalski, but Strike is the one who received it and responded.\n3. It is mentioned that Space Admiral Gorman had no great affection for either the Cleopatra or her crew, which suggests that he might not like them.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that Gorman's feelings towards Strike are not positive.

The crew of the Cleopatra was relieved of their assignment and duty in the Inner Planet Patrol Group and assigned to temporary duty at the Bureau of Research and Development.\n4. The message from Commander Strykalski to Commander David Farragut Strykalski VII mentioned that the Cleopatra would proceed without delay to the Fleet Experimental Substation on Tethys.\n5. The Cleopatra was fueled and armed for space within three hours, and then she lifted from the ramp outside the Substation dome.\n6. The ship was heading towards the Eridanus system, which is 8.5 light years away from Sol.\n\nConsidering the information above, the Cleopatra's travel time from Tethys to Eridanus is mentioned as 3 weeks, not in terms of light years or hours.\n\n \nD"

Ivy Hendricks, the engineering officer, had been working on this project and was in charge of the experiment. When the Eridans launched a major invasion of the solar Combine, the Cleopatra was tasked with making a diversionary attack on the planet 40 Eridani C II. To do this effectively, they needed to go into hyperspace to reach the Eridans before they could be ordered to attack.\n\nThe order to go into hyperspace was given by Strike in response to the Eridans' attack, to try and outrun their force net and gain an advantage in the battle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA"

The ship, Cleopatra, had entered the alien cosmos after using the hyper drive, which allowed it to break through the barrier between their own space and the alien cosmos.\n2. The ship was able to navigate through the alien space because the hyper drive allowed it to travel above light speed, making it possible for the ship to travel through space-time in a non-linear fashion.\n3. The ship's astrogator, Bayne, was able to plot a course to 40 Eridani C, which suggests that he was able to calculate the route through the alien space.\n4. There is no mention of the ship being able to sight alien stars or discover new planetary systems as a means of navigation.\n\nConsidering these points, the most logical conclusion is that the ship was able to navigate through the alien cosmos because they were able to calculate the route using the hyper drive and their knowledge of the destination.\n\nA."

The Eridians are described as a group-minded, non-human intelligence that lives in frozen worlds that are untenable for humans.\n2. They are isolationist and refuse any commerce with the Solar Combine.\n3. They are suspected of having interstellar flight capabilities.\n4. The passage states that the Eridans launched a major invasion of the solar Combine, specifically targeting the colonies in Centaurus.\n\nGiven this information, we can infer that the Eridians' primary motivation for engaging in war is not to avenge the Tellurians (D) or to sense an ambush (B), but rather to assert their power and expand their territory. The passage does not mention a specific threat to their ability to overtake new planets and systems (A), but it does imply that they are taking aggressive action to achieve their goals.\n\nHowever, the passage does mention that the Eridans are \"warlike\" and that they are guided by a \"group-mind.\" This suggests that their actions may be driven by a collective instinct or imperative, rather than a specific goal or motivation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely answer is:\n\nA. Their ability to overtake new planets and systems was not mentioned as a reason, but their warlike nature and the fact that they launched an invasion suggests that they may be motivated by a desire to expand their territory and assert their dominance.\n\nHowever, considering the provided options, I will choose:\n\nA"
