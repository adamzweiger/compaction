The speech is being remembered by Westover while he is on the monster's back, which suggests that the speaker is not physically present at that moment.\n2. The speech is about the biology and behavior of the monsters, which implies that the speaker is likely a scientist or expert in the field.\n3. The speech mentions the monsters' ability to propel themselves through space, which is consistent with the idea that the speaker is discussing the monsters from a detached perspective, possibly from a safe location.\n4. The speech is not mentioned as being given to Westover directly, but rather as something he remembers from the past.\n\nConsidering these points, it's likely that the speaker is not physically present with Westover on the monster's back. The most plausible option is that the speaker is far away, possibly in space or on a distant planet.\n\n \n\nB"

He was aware that he had lost track of the days and that the monsters had probably finished their destruction of Earth. He realized that he had been isolated for a long time and that his mind had been affected by the solitude. He was also aware that the monsters would soon be leaving Earth, which meant that any remaining human survivors would be left to fend for themselves.\n\nThe situation made Westover feel the most upset because he was worried about the long-term survival of humanity, not just his own survival. He was concerned that humanity would be left to starve and fight over the last remaining resources, which would lead to a terrible end. This concern was what made him feel the most upset.\n\n**C**"

The passage mentions that Westover had been walking for two days and nights without stopping, indicating that he was physically exhausted.\n2. It also states that he had been following the high ground towards the hills, splashing through water and climbing onto dry knolls, suggesting that he was traversing a challenging terrain.\n3. When he encounters the monster, he is described as being \"dead tired out on his feet.\"\n\nConsidering these points, the most likely reason for Westover's shrinking is that he was tired from walking a long way.\n\n**D**"

This makes option A a possible reason for his sickness, but it is not the only option to consider.\n\nThe text does not mention Westover experiencing motion sickness, so option C is unlikely to be the reason.\n\nThe text does not mention the taste of the monster's flesh being bad, so option D is unlikely to be the reason.\n\nConsidering the options, the most plausible reason for Westover feeling sick to his stomach is that he had been fasting a long time (option A).\n\nA"

He understood that he had to leave the monster now.\n\nAs he looked around, he saw the ocean and the distant coastline, and he heard muffled voices. He thought the voices might be real and shouted for help. A shadow fell across him, and he saw an elderly man, the Preacher, who told him to follow him.\n\nThe Preacher led him to a burrow in the monster's side, and they crawled through it into a large cavern. Inside the cavern, Westover saw a group of people, tools, and equipment, including a device that was making air.\n\nThe group was led by Sutton, a biologist who had been working on a way to survive inside the monster. Westover learned that he had been living on the monster's back as a parasite and that Sutton's group had been working on a way to make the monster's blood give up its oxygen, which would allow them to survive.\n\nSo, considering the options, the correct answer is:\n\nA"

To find some other people - This is a goal of Westover's.\nD.

The story describes a massive, mindless, and gigantic monster that has come out of interstellar space to devour Earth.\n2. The monster has been gnawing at the Earth's soil and drinking from its seas, causing widespread destruction.\n3. The monster's body has formed an unbreakable dam, causing the river to flood and further devastating the planet.\n4. The narrator, Westover, is trying to find a way to survive and possibly stop the monster, but he is struggling to find a safe haven.\n5. The story mentions that the monsters have been gutting the continents and churning the sea bottoms, implying a massive destruction of the planet's ecosystem.\n\nConsidering these points, the most likely reason for Earth's bleak state is that the monsters have caused widespread destruction, leading to a collapse of human civilization.\n\n**C**"

They can be killed by administering a specific type of cut near their head: This is not mentioned in the passage. Westover does have an idea for killing the monsters, but it involves isolating a potent secretion from their blood and reintroducing it to the system.\n\nC. They can produce fuel which lets them fly: This is not mentioned in the passage. The passage mentions that the monster's body contains great vacuoles that can be expelled to drive the monster forward like a reaction engine, but it does not mention flying.\n\nD. They can float on water: This is indeed something Westover discovers about the monsters. He realizes that the monster will crawl into the sea, which will float its bloated bulk and enable it to accelerate and take flight.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB"

The beginning of the passage describes a desolate, post-apocalyptic world where a monster has devastated Earth. The tone is bleak and hopeless.\n2. Westover's journey is marked by despair, desperation, and a sense of futility as he tries to find a way to survive and escape the monster.\n3. However, when Westover discovers the monster's ability to generate gases and prepare to leave Earth, the tone shifts to a sense of urgency and desperation.\n4. The introduction of the Preacher and the discovery of the underground colony marks a significant shift in tone. The atmosphere becomes more hopeful and optimistic, as Westover encounters other survivors who are working together to find a solution.\n5. The conversation between Westover and Sutton reveals a more nuanced and complex tone, as they discuss the implications of their situation and the potential risks and consequences of their actions.\n6. The final section of the passage takes a darker turn, as Sutton expresses concerns about the potential dangers of their situation and the need to control population growth.\n\nBased on this analysis, the tone of the passage shifts from bleak and hopeless to hopeful and optimistic, but then shifts again to a more nuanced and complex tone, and finally to a darker and more ominous tone.\n\n**C**"

Westover's actions and discoveries are not widely known to other humans, as he is isolated on the monster's back and later in the underground burrow.\n2. He shares his idea with Sutton, but it is not clear if this information will be passed on to the rest of humanity.\n3. Sutton is concerned that Westover's idea could lead to the destruction of the monsters that humans are currently living inside, which would be catastrophic for humanity's survival.\n4. Sutton suggests that Westover's idea should be recorded in a way that can only be deciphered by intelligent people, implying that it's not suitable for the general public to know.\n\nConsidering these points, it's unlikely that Westover will be remembered as the man who discovered that humans can eat the monsters or the man who first knew the way to destroy the monsters. The information about humans living inside the monsters is not a discovery that Westover makes, but rather something that he discovers he is already a part of.\n\nTherefore, Westover is likely to be remembered as the man who discovered that humans can live inside the monsters.\n\nD"

Sutton's voice in the passage mentions that the monsters are \"like the slime molds, the Earthly life forms that most resemble them.\"\n4.
