However, we can compare the May 2017 and June 2019 results.\n\nThe creatinine level decreased from 1.22 mg/dL in May 2017 to 1.10 mg/dL in June 2019.\n\nSince we are comparing two different time points and not the exact time period mentioned in the question (August 2016 to June 2019), we can still infer that the creatinine level decreased over time.\n\nHowever, without the exact lab result for August 2016, we can only make an educated guess based on the available information.\n\n\n \nB"
