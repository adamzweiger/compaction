Beneath them, the jagged peak of the mountain almost grazed the hull. Spread out under their eyes was the panorama of a dead planet... To the north a mountain range... To the south, beyond the rocks, lay a white waste of desert.\"\n\nThis indicates the ship landed *between* the mountains and desert, with the mountains being a key landmark.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\nD"

Surprised at the way they looked:** The text mentions Irgi found them \"queer\" and noted their two legs and two arms, but this isn't a strong emotional reaction like surprise.\n*   **B. Confused about why they were there:** He initially is simply curious about their presence and purpose.\n*   **C. Disappointed they could not speak to him through their minds:** This is a key detail. Irgi attempted to communicate telepathically and was disappointed they didn't respond.\n*   **D. Happy they had a disease:** Irgi was glad to find the disease because he thought he could cure it and use them to build statues.\n\nTherefore, option C best reflects Irgi's feelings.\n\nC"

He reached to a series of black knobs inset in the wall, and turned them carefully. Turning, he saw the figures of the four men stiffen to rigidity as a red aura drifted upward from the tabletop, passing through them as if they were mist, rising upwards to dissipate in the air near the ceiling.\"\n\nIt also mentions, \"It was the sweat of agony trickling down his forehead and over his eyes and cheeks that woke Emerson. He opened his eyes, then clamped them shut as his body writhed in pain.\"\n\nThis indicates that Irgi used a red aura that caused intense pain and a feeling of being cut or pierced. While the description is metaphorical (\"as if they were mist\"), it aligns with the idea of preparing them for something rather than outright vivisection or burning. The passage states he was preparing their \"bodies for the Chamber of the Cones.\"\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B.\n\nB"

Nichols:** Nichols is motivated by concern for his family and Earth, but he doesn't directly influence Irgi.\n*   **D. Washington:** Irgi sees a statue of George Washington and wonders what he did to merit such fame, suggesting a respect for leadership and potential good deeds. This sparks a desire to help.\n\nIrgi is inspired to help after viewing the images of Earth and its problems, and after seeing Washington\u2019s statue which represents leadership.\n\nD"

They died from a disease caused by a microbe:** The story mentions the Plague on Earth and that Irgi discovered the mist to preserve his people's treasures, implying a catastrophe rather than a slow decline from a microbe-borne illness.\n*   **C. They moved to another planet:** There's no indication they migrated. Irgi is a solitary guardian of a dead planet.\n*   **D. They died from cancer:** The story explicitly states Irgi discovered the mist \"when it was too late to save his kind,\" and connects the growth disease/cancer to the cosmic rays.

Alien conquerors:** There's no mention of alien invaders.\n*   **C. Bioweapon:** While Irgi did use a mist, it's described as a discovery made \"when it was too late to save his kind,\" suggesting it was more of a desperate measure than a deliberate bioweapon. The text also notes the mist destroyed dust and germs, implying it was meant to preserve, not destroy.\n*   **D. Radiation sickness:** The text states Irgi discovered the mist \"many years ago, when it was too late to save his kind.\" It also mentions he used the cones and block of radiant matter to keep himself immortal, suggesting a connection to a kind of energy/radiation. This aligns with the idea that a similar ailment, like radiation sickness, could have wiped out the Urg people while Irgi, through his mastery of the cones, was spared.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most plausible explanation based on the provided text.\n\nD"

He is taking a bath in ultraviolet light, which is how Urgians cleanse themselves, since their planet is now devoid of water.** The text mentions the mist destroying dust and germs, but doesn't state they have no water or use UV light for cleansing.\n*   **B. The light just feels good, kind of like warming your hands over a campfire. Since there is no one to stop him, he just basks in the light for pleasure.** The text states he \"preens his body\" and that the light gives a \"faint tingle\" that \"spread outwards.\" While he seems to enjoy it, it's described more as part of a process than pure pleasure.\n*   **C. He is self-administering the treatment for space cancer, as he must do once per Urgian year.** The text explicitly states the blue light makes him immortal and that it \u201ccleansed and nourished\u201d the \u201clife spark\u201d within him. This strongly suggests a restorative or life-extending treatment.\n*   **D. He is engaging in a religious purification ritual that had been done by everyone on his planet for thousands of years.** While it could be a ritual, the text focuses on the scientific discovery and its implications for immortality, not a religious tradition.\n\nConsidering the explicit link to immortality and life sustenance, option C seems the most fitting inference.\n\nC"

It wasn't a crash landing. Also, Irgi wasn't aimlessly wandering when he encountered the ship.\n*   **Option C:** There's no mention of Earth contacting Urg or any prior notification of a mission.\n*   **Option D:** The text explicitly states that \"It was a spaceship,\" and Irgi \"stared upwards\" and \"said, 'By the Block,'...

Simple: Space Force Command simply picked the four most expendable people who could run a spaceship.** The text mentions the \"stupendous fees\" paid to crew members, implying they were willing to risk their lives for the money, but doesn't explicitly state they were chosen for expendability.\n*   **B. Simple: all four men were lifelong friends, having grown up together, even if two of them did go bad and end up in prison.** The text indicates no prior relationship between the crew members.\n*   **C. Simple: traveling in space was known to be a death sentence due to the sickness induced by cosmic rays, so no one else wanted to go.** This aligns strongly with the text, which describes space travel as leading to \"a hideous death\" from \"space cancer\" and notes that the mission required men \"who believed in a short life and a merry one.\"\n*   **D. Simple: they were the only four people left on Earth healthy enough to try to make the journey.** The text doesn't suggest anyone else was even considered, let alone that Earth was depleted of healthy candidates.\n\nTherefore, option C is the most accurate explanation based on the provided text.\n\nC"

The passage explicitly states that Irgi restrained the crew, and then used an \"electragraph screen\" that tapped into their brain waves, converting them into images that Irgi could see. This is a one-way process, allowing Irgi to view their thoughts.\n*   **Option C:** While Irgi initially realizes his voice frequency is too low, he doesn't raise it to a level where two-way audible communication is established. The focus is on brainwave interpretation, not vocal exchange.\n*   **Option D:** The passage indicates Irgi initiates the process, reading their thoughts, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n\nB"

She too, had the growth disease... The thoughts of this Emerson were coming in clearer... the necessity for radium, and the danger of the growth disease he did.\"\n\nThis indicates that Irgi recognizes the human suffering from the disease he himself conquered. He then concludes, \"Why, he had the power to make himself immortal! These creatures would gladly build statues to him! True, he could not create a nation\u2014but he could save it!\"\n\nThis directly corresponds to option A: It occurs to him that he could save the human race from space cancer using the same special cleansing energy source that saved him.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n\nB is about recreating Urg, which isn't mentioned.\nC is about Mussdorf\u2019s potential issues, which is a later realization.\nD is about DNA hybridization, which isn't a relevant thought process for Irgi at this point.\n\n\n\nA"

The story emphasizes the communication barrier and the misunderstanding arising from his actions.\n*   **B:** This is the most accurate answer. Irgi assumes the Earthlings will understand his intentions \u2013 that they'll perceive his actions as benevolent even though they are being restrained and subjected to pain. He doesn\u2019t consider that without communication, his actions will be interpreted as hostile.\n*   **C:** Irgi does not appear to be overly concerned with the moral character of the humans. His focus is on saving the species, and he assumes they will be receptive.\n*   **D:** This isn't Irgi's primary failing. The story focuses on the immediate interaction and miscommunication, not long-term logistical problems.\n\nTherefore, the crucial point Irgi fails to consider is the potential for misunderstanding and hostile interpretation due to the lack of communication.\n\nB"
