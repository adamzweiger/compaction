Billy is described as a \"big rawboned brute of a girl\" who has a \"loud, strident voice\" and summons Jonathan to dinner.\n2. She is the one who says \"Quiet!\" and pounds the table to get everyone's attention.\n3. She is also the one who says \"Let him be. He can't go anywhere for a few days. He's just been through a wreck. He needs rest.\"\n\nBased on these clues, I believe Billy is the rawboned girl who cooked dinner.\n\n**A**"

They are able to hunt and climb, which suggests they have a good level of physical fitness.\n3. However, there is no mention of them undergoing any special training or consuming any unusual substances that would enhance their strength.\n4. The environment on the asteroid is described as having lower gravity, which is a crucial detail.\n\nConsidering these points, the most logical explanation for the women's strength is the lower gravity on the asteroid. This would naturally lead to a significant increase in their strength relative to what they would have on Earth.\n\n**D**"

He says he was all by himself, as his co-pilot had an attack of space sickness on Mars and he left him there.\n3. He also mentions that he would stay at the controls as long as he could, then lock her on her course and snatch a couple of hours' sleep.\n\nConsidering these points, it's likely that Jonathan's exhaustion played a role in the crash. He was flying solo, had only a few hours of sleep, and was likely operating on autopilot for extended periods. This combination of factors makes it probable that he fell asleep at the controls, leading to the crash.\n\nA"

The Interstellar Cosmography Society's space cruiser arrives, and they are about to leave.\n3. Jonathan is asked if he has any personal belongings he'd like to take with him.\n4. Instead of mentioning the women, Jonathan asks if anyone knows how to grow tobacco, indicating he wants to stay on the asteroid.\n5. Jonathan is adamant about staying on the asteroid, and the crew is surprised by his decision.\n\nConsidering these points, the most likely reason Jonathan doesn't tell the Interstellar Cosmography Society about the women is that he wants to stay on the asteroid and be with them. However, the text doesn't suggest he wants to keep them all to himself or that he's motivated by a desire for revenge. Therefore, the most plausible explanation is that he wants to stay on the asteroid and enjoy their company, but the text doesn't explicitly state this.\n\nHowever, the correct option is not B, as it's not explicitly mentioned in the text. The text does not suggest that Jonathan is motivated by a desire for revenge (A), and it's unlikely that he would keep the women a secret to protect them from the Interstellar Cosmography Society (C), as the crew seems to be a group of scientists rather than a group that would harm the women.\n\nThe correct answer is **D** doesn't fit, because there is no indication that the space cruiser is full, and it's not the reason Jonathan gives for not telling the crew about the women.\n\nHowever, the correct answer is **C**. The text doesn't explicitly state that the Interstellar Cosmography Society would take advantage of the women, but it does suggest that they are a group of scientists who are not particularly interested in the women's well-being."

When the opportunity to leave with the Interstellar Cosmography Society arose, he chose to stay on the asteroid instead.\n\nHe doesn't express any dissatisfaction with his life as a pilot, so option A is unlikely. Option B is also unlikely, as the text doesn't suggest that Jonathan was put off by Doctor Boynton's demeanor.\n\nOption C is a possible reason, but it's not the only reason. The text does mention that Jonathan was attracted to the women, especially Ann Clotilde, but it's not the primary reason he decides to stay.\n\nThe most likely reason Jonathan decides to stay on the asteroid is that he wants to stay and enjoy the comforts and luxuries provided by the women, and he also wants to keep the tobacco seeds for himself. This is evident when he says, \"Do any of you know how to grow tobacco?\" and then decides to stay on the asteroid.\n\n**D**"
