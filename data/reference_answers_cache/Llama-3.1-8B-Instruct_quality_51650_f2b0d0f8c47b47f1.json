He was initially unsuccessful due to Earth's gravity, but when he got the rhythm, he threw a row of sevens, which is a customary form of challenge on Mars. However, the people at the table were not playing with substituted dice, and they simply pushed chips towards him. Matheny then said, \"I say! I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\" A middle-aged lady told him, \"Sir! This is a church!\" This implies that Matheny was not aware that the game was not being played for money in a conventional way, but rather as a form of worship. He was likely embarrassed because he was not understanding the context of the game in a religious setting.\n\nC"

He also mentions the \"Little Girl\" project, where they created a story about a dying girl collecting Earth coins, which made them a billion dollars.\n3. He talks about the Red Ankh Society, a fictional organization that sells a book claiming to reveal the secrets of the Old Martians.\n4. He also mentions the idea of organizing a Martian bucket shop, handling Martian securities.\n\nNow, let's count the cons:\n\n- Manufacturing relics: 1\n- The \"Little Girl\" project: 1\n- The Red Ankh Society: 1\n- Martian bucket shop: 1\n\nThere are 4 different cons mentioned.\n\n**A**"

The Martians are struggling to earn enough dollars to develop their planet.\n4. Matheny mentions that they have tried to attract capital from Earth, but no one is interested.\n5. He specifically mentions that they need someone who knows Earth and can help them \"dodge the tax bite and... tell us what will appeal to your people.\"\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that the Martians are struggling to compete with Earth's corporations and need help to increase their earnings.

It does mention that he is not used to the gravity, but it does not say it hurts his feet.\n\n- Option B: Matheny's clothes are described as being outdated, but it is not explicitly stated that this is what bothers him the most.\n\n- Option C: Matheny is indeed yelled at by an official, but it is not described as the hardest part of his experience.\n\n- Option D: The text describes the air on Earth as \"heavy\" or \"suffocating\" and that Matheny finds it hard to breathe. This is stated in the following passage: \"The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected. Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts. What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD"

The mention of Earth corporations and their ability to \"buy and sell our whole planet before breakfast\" suggests that Earth has a significant economic advantage over Mars.\n\nConsidering these points, it's clear that Mars is struggling to keep up with Earth's economic and technological advancements.\n\nA.

The story begins with Peri receiving a call from Gus Doran, which is described as \"tonight\". This implies that the story starts in the evening.\n2. The story then shifts to Peter Matheny, who has just arrived on Earth. He is in a dropshaft, surrounded by people in various states of dress, and it's described as \"August twilight\", which suggests that the day is ending.\n3. Matheny is in the Church of Choice, playing games and drinking, and then he and Gus Doran go to a bar, where they talk for several hours, discussing business and other topics.\n4. After the bar, Matheny and Doran go to a hotel, where they order clothes and drinks, and then Doran suggests going out to find women. This is described as \"not too late to catch them at home\", which suggests that it's still evening.\n5. The story does not provide a clear indication of how long Matheny and Doran spend in the hotel room, but it's likely a short period, given the context.\n\nConsidering these time indicators, it's likely that the entire story takes place within a short period, probably less than a day.
