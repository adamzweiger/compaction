They were struggling to understand Korvin's answers and were getting frustrated. This lack of understanding led to them not being able to fully comprehend Korvin's nature and intentions. \n\nTheir subconscious, which is not bound by their logical and rational thinking, was able to process and understand Korvin's situation better. It realized that Korvin was not a threat, but rather a puzzle that they couldn't solve, and that dealing with him was becoming a burden. \n\nThe subconscious, without the logical constraints, made a decision to help Korvin escape, essentially \"making the problem disappear\" by removing it from their midst.\n\n \nB"

It also does not imply that the Tr'en used advanced technology to teach him while he was unconscious.\n\nThe phrase \"under drug hypnosis\" is not mentioned in the text, but it is a plausible explanation for Korvin being unconscious during the language lessons. This would allow the Tr'en to teach him the language quickly and efficiently.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: \nA"

The Tr'en had a lie-detector machine that was adjusted to Korvin's physiology, indicating that it was designed to accurately detect lies.\n2. Korvin was strapped down to the machine and questioned about his mission, but he was able to answer the questions truthfully without revealing the true intent of his mission.\n3. The Tr'en experts were puzzled by Korvin's answers, suggesting that the machine was not detecting lies as expected.\n4. Korvin's answers were not simple or evasive, but rather, they were precise and literal, which is evident from the text.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible explanation is that Korvin was able to avoid disclosing the true intent of his mission by saying truths that literally answered the Tr'en's questions but evaded the intent behind their questions.\n\n**B**"

It is stated that \"every night the guards came in and gave him a concentrated lesson in the local language, but Korvin failed to get much pleasure out of that, being unconscious at the time.\" This suggests that Korvin is not being punished, as he is still receiving lessons.\n3. The passage does not mention anything about Tr'en prisoners or the possibility of an uprising.\n4. The Tr'en are described as a logical and efficient people, but there is no indication that they don't see the need for social interaction.\n\nGiven this information, the most plausible explanation for Korvin's solitude is that solitary confinement was part of the Tr'en's standard procedure for holding prisoners, rather than a specific punishment for Korvin.\n\n**B**"

Korvin's answers to the Tr'en's questions often seem illogical or paradoxical to them, but the lie-detector indicates that he is telling the truth.\n3. The Tr'en are stumped by Korvin's answers, and their experts are unable to resolve the contradictions.\n4. The Tr'en's failure to understand Korvin's answers is not due to a faulty lie-detector, as they are able to detect when Korvin is lying.\n5. There is no indication that Korvin switches the wires on the lie-detector or that the Ruler is simple-minded.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely reason for the Tr'en's failure is that their logic is too narrow and does not account for complexities like motivations, emotions, and what's left unsaid.\n\n**B**"

However, the expert's statement about Korvin aiding the Tr'en to conquer Earth is likely a misinterpretation of Korvin's words, as Korvin's plan is to deceive the Tr'en, not to aid them.\n\nThe key point is that Korvin's mission is successful, and he sends a message back to Earth Central saying the Tr'en won't come marauding out into space.

The Tr'en become increasingly frustrated and agitated as they struggle to comprehend Korvin's explanations, but they do not resort to violence or aggression.\n5.

Korvin has already been given a concentrated lesson in the local language by the guards, but he failed to get much pleasure out of it because he was unconscious at the time.\n4. The passage mentions that the Tr'en literalist approach to the smallest problems of everyday living is a little hard to get the hang of, and Korvin notes that they are not equipped for the mental sciences.\n\nConsidering these points, it is likely that the Tr'en do not infer the situational meaning of a question, which is a crucial aspect of language understanding in human communication.
