Ganti's disappearance and the circumstances surrounding it (being forced to give his wife to a governor) fuel Jorgenson's frustration and resentment towards the Thrid system.\n*   **B. He needed his business to support his family:** The text doesn't mention Jorgenson having a family. The focus is on the injustice and frustration caused by the situation.\n*   **C. He came to the planet to defeat Glen-U\u2019s dictatorship:** The text states Jorgenson was there to run a trading post and initially didn't want to interfere with the local social system.\n*   **D. He believed anyone to be capable of making mistakes:** While Jorgenson *does* eventually realize Glen-U can make mistakes, his initial anger stems from the fact that the Thrid culture doesn't allow for any possibility of error, and that his business is being unjustly taken based on this flawed system. This isn't his core reason for anger.\n\nTherefore, the primary driver of Jorgenson's anger is the situation surrounding Ganti and the general injustice of the Thrid system.\n\nA"

Extensive study of nearby planetary governance successes:** The text explicitly states the Thrid believe they are the \"most intelligent race in the universe\" and that their system must be perfect because any mistakes would require them to be imperfect. This suggests a strong belief in their own inherent superiority rather than learning from others.\n*   **B. Their ancient scriptures:** While there\u2019s mention of a \"Grand Panjandrum\" speaking truths, it's framed as a continuous observation rather than referencing specific written texts. The emphasis is on the *saying* itself, not the source.\n*   **C. Opinion:** The entire system revolves around absolute certainty and the impossibility of error. Opinion would directly contradict that core belief.\n*   **D. Wisdom of the supreme family lineage:** There's no mention of family lineage or inheritance of power in the text. The Grand Panjandrum seems to be an individual with a unique, almost mystical ability to speak absolute truths.\n\nGiven the text's emphasis on inherent intelligence, the idea of an infallible Grand Panjandrum, and the rigid adherence to pronouncements, the system is driven by the belief in their own inherent wisdom and the certainty of the Grand Panjandrum's pronouncements.\n\nB"

This is because the Thrid believe the accuser must be either a criminal (and punished with hard labor) or insane (and confined).\n\nC is close, but it's what happens if the *governor* is mistaken, not the accuser.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB"

It was never ordered:** The text states they were sent to a remote island, indicating a deliberate act, not a simple oversight. Thus, it was likely ordered, so this isn't correct.\n*   **B. They had intellectually outsmarted the Thrid by making it seem a mistake to kill them:** The passage suggests the Thrid operate on a system where admitting a mistake is incredibly difficult. Jorgenson's actions created a situation where killing them would highlight the Grand Panjandrum's error. This aligns well with the Thrid's rigid adherence to avoiding mistakes.\n*   **C. They had ally Witnesses in the government that secretly kept them alive:** There\u2019s no mention of allies or witnesses actively protecting them.\n*   **D. They proved to be useful in their resourcefulness:** While their resourcefulness is evident, the text doesn\u2019t explicitly state it was a factor in their continued survival \u2013 merely that they were left to live on the island.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible reason, based on the passage, is that their mere existence, as prisoners defying the Grand Panjandrum's decree, highlighted the impossibility of the Panjandrum being wrong, effectively preventing their execution.\n\nB"

      "generated_text": "Let's analyze Jorgenson's reasoning and compare it to that of the Thrid.\n\n*   **Jorgenson:** Initially, he's driven by emotion (anger at the injustice and concern for Ganti) and reacts impulsively, declaring the Grand Panjandrum mistaken. However, he then strategically plans his escape, meticulously experimenting and adapting based on observations and trial-and-error. He uses logic to deduce how to manipulate the copter crew.\n*   **The Thrid:** Their culture is built on the absolute certainty that the Grand Panjandrum *cannot* be wrong. This belief is the foundation of their society and prevents them from questioning authority, even when faced with illogical outcomes. They prioritize adherence to rules and the supposed infallibility of their leader above all else.\n\nNow let's examine the options:\n\n*   **A. Neither required evidence to draw conclusions:** While Jorgenson initially acts emotionally, his escape plan is based on observation and testing \u2013 a form of evidence. The Thrid's beliefs are rooted in a cultural dogma, not necessarily evidence.\n*   **B. Neither allowed nuance:** The Thrid definitely don't allow nuance; their system is rigid and absolute. Jorgenson, however, *does* show a capacity for nuance as he adapts his plans and considers Ganti\u2019s perspective.\n*   **C. Both were skeptical of novel ideas:** This is incorrect. The Thrid are incredibly resistant to anything that challenges their established order. Jorgenson, while initially resistant, demonstrates a willingness to innovate and explore new approaches for escape.\n*   **D. Both followed intuition:** While there's a spark of intuition in Jorgenson\u2019s initial outburst, his later actions are driven by logical planning and experimentation. The Thrid operate on rigid adherence to a system, not intuition.\n\nThe closest similarity is their unyielding belief system - Jorgenson's is that the Grand Panjandrum *can* be wrong, and the Thrid believe he absolutely *cannot*. While this is a directly opposing belief, the manner in which they each hold and act upon their deeply held belief is somewhat alike.\n\nB\n\n\n\nB"

But also, and contradictorily, he saw them as right and just, or as wrong and intolerable.\" This directly indicates a conflict between his business instincts and his moral sense. He *should* focus on business, but he's bothered by the injustices on Thriddar. The passage further explains he \"liked the Thrid\" despite their \"intolerable convictions\" and that he gets \"fed up\" with the officials. He is conflicted between behaving as a detached businessman and reacting to what he sees as unfairness.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are incorrect:\n\n*   **A:** The text doesn't say his business is \"too lucrative\" to leave. The issue isn't about profit; it's about principle.\n*   **B:** The story establishes that Jorgenson *refuses* to give his trading post to the Grand Panjandrum, so this isn't a conflict he faces.\n*   **C:** While the situation involves the Thrid, the conflict isn't specifically about making money at the expense of Ganti, but more generally, about the injustice of their societal structure.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n\n\nD"

It could even be dangerous.\"), but he acts out of a sense of injustice stemming from Ganti's situation and a general dislike of the Thrid social system.\n*   **D:** The text explicitly states that Jorgenson's impending departure is *not* a factor in his decision to contradict the Grand Panjandrum.\n\nC"
