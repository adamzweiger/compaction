The bells had sounded, warning every soul on it to take shelter, to strap themselves in their pressure bunks against the deadly stress of acceleration as the ship reversed itself and began to slow its headlong plunge into Callisto.\"\n\nThis directly indicates that the danger stems from the \"deadly stress of acceleration\" during the course reversal and that people need to be in \"pressure bunks\" to protect themselves. This aligns with option C.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n*   A: While zero gravity is mentioned, it's not the primary danger.\n*   B: The passage specifies \"pressure bunks,\" implying pressure is the key concern, not just speed.\n*   D: The passage mentions lights going out, but this is a consequence, not the primary reason for the danger.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nC"

This option is plausible.\n* **B:** This is the correct answer. The nurse explicitly states that Stevens died an hour *before* Duane woke up, and his death was due to injuries sustained from the rocket's course change (\"He was underneath when the jets went on. Three ribs broken\u2014his lung was punctured.\").\n* **C:** Andrias' statement cannot be trusted as he's trying to manipulate Duane.\n* **D:** The text says Duane's hand \"touched\" the gun but didn't fire it before the ship changed course.\n\nB"

A regular nurse wouldn't likely express such personal concern or question Duane\u2019s memory in this way. Mother is unlikely given the context and tone. A coworker seems less intimate than the language suggests.\n\nC"

This aligns directly with the provided information.\n*   **B. They each thought they had time to kill the other before the course change started.** While there's animosity, the text doesn't suggest they believed they had *time* to kill each other; it emphasizes their argument and escalating tension.\n*   **C. They thought they were skilled enough to weather the course change outside the bunks.** There's no indication of their skill or belief in their ability to withstand the forces.\n*   **D. They didn't think the heavy-set man in blue knew what he was talking about.** The heavy-set man's comment is a minor detail and irrelevant to why they ignored the warning.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is A.\n\nA"

However, the text doesn't explicitly state that Duane initially believed he was promised a hundred thousand.\n*   **Option D:** This accurately reflects the situation \u2013 Stevens reneges on the original promise, offering only ten thousand dollars when Duane expected fifty thousand. This is a key point of conflict.\n*   **Option A:** This is a consequence of the situation, not the primary reason. Cutting Duane out of the deal is a result of Stevens' actions, not Duane's initial intention.\n*   **Option B:** Duane says he will have to kill Stevens because of the reduced payment, so this is a direct consequence of the events.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is that Duane wants to kill Stevens because Stevens is drastically reducing the payment Duane expected.\n\nD"

It makes him forget why he so desperately needed the money from Andrias.** The passage states Duane's memory is gone, but it doesn't explicitly say he forgets *why* he needed the money. He's aware of needing it and expresses frustration about it. So, this is likely incorrect.\n\n*   **B. It gives him perspective on the how malicious and self-centered his past actions were.** Duane's memory loss allows him to view his past actions (like killing Stevens) with a sense of detachment and horror. He explicitly states \"Whatever they say, I'm not a killer!\" This suggests a shift in perspective brought on by not remembering his motivations.\n\n*   **C. It makes him forget his former hatred for the League.** The passage doesn't indicate any prior hatred for the League. Instead, the situation reveals that Andrias is betraying the League. Duane's amnesia doesn't seem to alter his feelings about them.\n\n*   **D. A combination of both B and C.** While option B is the strongest factor, the absence of prior negative feelings towards the League supports the possibility that a general clearing of past biases contributed to his change of heart.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is a combination of B and C.\n\nD"

The text states \"And the lights went out in a burst of crashing pain for Peter Duane.\" and then mentions the nurse finding Stevens dead an hour later.

He had killed someone:** While Duane had killed someone, the text doesn't link this to his inability to recognize the girl.\n*   **D. He was playing dumb:** He claims he doesn't know her, but he also states he doesn't know who he is, suggesting genuine confusion rather than deception.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is that Duane's memory loss (due to head injury) is why he didn't recognize the girl.\n\nB"

This implies that the guard's presence was needed *after* the signing.
