He liked it there:** The text explicitly states he hated canned food, cramped spaces, and the lack of basic amenities, describing it as a \"smelly little hut.\" This contradicts him liking it.\n*   **B. He was glad to have the opportunity to stay longer:** He repeatedly rejects the offer to stay and expresses a strong desire to leave.\n*   **C. He couldn't wait to leave:** This aligns with the text. He yearns for Earth's atmosphere, blue skies, green grass, and human interaction. He expresses a strong desire to return.\n*   **D. He would stay longer for more money:** He rejects the offer of a doubled salary and a bonus, indicating money isn't his primary motivator.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nC"

He spent a lot of time sitting and thinking about her:** The text says, \"You just get to thinking and wanting\u2014and there's nothing you can do about it.\" While he was thinking about her, the text doesn't explicitly state that he spent \"a lot of time\" doing so.\n*   **C. He didn't want to leave but was motivated by the pay:** This is the best fit. The text states, \"There wasn't much sense in talking about it. You just get to thinking and wanting\u2014and there's nothing you can do about it.\" Then, \"But I can see their reasons for it. But who could pass up the money the Commission was paying?\" This indicates a degree of reluctance combined with financial incentive.\n*   **D.

This isn't the primary motivation.\n*   **B. He's gone a little crazy from being on the moon too long:** While Chapman does express some weariness and longing for Earth, the text doesn't portray him as having lost his sanity. The equipment checks appear reasoned.\n*   **C. It's his assigned duty:** The text doesn't explicitly state this is his duty. However, his prolonged stay and experience suggest he's taken on a caretaker role.\n*   **D. He doesn't think they can look after themselves:** Donley expresses annoyance at Chapman's constant checks (\"You watch us like an old mother hen\"). This indicates Chapman believes the others need his oversight, demonstrating a lack of confidence in their self-sufficiency, especially considering the dangers of the lunar environment.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D.\n\nD"

He shared how much he missed people:** This is a heartfelt sentiment and doesn't seem to cause him embarrassment.\n\n*   **C. He shared that he wanted to be naked outdoors:** The passage states, \"I think I'd like to go out in a rain storm and strip and feel the rain on my skin.\" This is a very personal and somewhat vulnerable desire, and it's immediately followed by the phrase \"He stopped, feeling a little sorry for Dahl. Chapman sympathized. If he had had any sense, he\u2019d have tried to smuggle something like that up to the Moon instead of his phonograph.\" This strongly suggests he felt embarrassed by sharing this desire.\n\n*   **D.

Insects invade the bunkers:** There's no mention of insects.\n*   **C. Plants are scientifically sampled:** The story mentions lichen specimens and, significantly, a plot of grass being brought to the moon to try and grow. This directly supports the idea of plant sampling.\n*   **D. There is zero life:** The presence of scientists, their research, and the attempted cultivation of grass demonstrates that there *is* life, albeit artificial and contained.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that plants are scientifically sampled.\n\nC"

He expresses concern about Dahl's capabilities and implies he's not well-suited for the role.\n\n*   **B. Worried that the younger astronaut will ruin what he accomplished:** This aligns strongly with the text. He is concerned that Dahl isn't up to the task and will not maintain the standards he established. He also makes a point of saying, \u201cCowardice is the one thing for which no man ever forgives himself,\" hinting at concern for the potential consequences of Dahl's actions.\n\n*   **C. Slighted that a younger scientist was offered the role in his place:** While there's a hint of annoyance at the offer, the story emphasizes his desire to leave and return to Earth. The main emotion isn't resentment.\n\n*   **D. Elated to finally be released:** While he *is* eager to leave, the story highlights a deeper feeling of disappointment and concern rather than simple elation. His farewell and final comments reveal a more complex emotional state.\n\nTherefore, option B best captures Chapman's feelings.\n\nB"

They are not portrayed as friendly.\n*   **D is partially true, but not the core of their relationship:** It's stated Dahl is engaged and wants to return to his fianc\u00e9e, but this isn\u2019t the main dynamic presented. It highlights his desperation, but doesn\u2019t define their relationship.\n\nTherefore, the best description of their relationship is that they are colleagues, but not friends, with a distinct power imbalance and Dahl exhibiting manipulative behavior.\n\nC"

Spying on Venus for Earth:** While a connection to Venus is mentioned, the text doesn't suggest spying as the primary reason for the moon station.\n*   **C. Erecting a telescope:** The story mentions a Schmidt telescope and that Dowden and Bening are mapping the sky. This suggests observation but not necessarily building a telescope.\n*   **D.

The older man then points out that psychologists believe couples should staff research stations and that this young man has a girlfriend. This establishes the young man's reluctance stems from personal attachments and a fear of losing his current life.\n\nLater in the story, Dahl is portrayed as someone who volunteered for stopover and seems less hesitant, even attempting to trade places with Chapman. Chapman is the one who has spent three years on the Moon and expresses a strong desire to return to Earth. Therefore, the young man at the beginning of the story is Chapman at a younger age.\n\nD"
