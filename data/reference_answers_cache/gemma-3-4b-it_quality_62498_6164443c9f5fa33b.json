Pop, on the other hand, expresses concern about the difficulty of the journey, the uncertainty of their new life, and the potential for things to go wrong (\"Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my dream on all of you\").

Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my dream on all of you. The world we have known and loved lies behind us. Before us lies only uncertainty.\u2019\u201d This clearly indicates that Pop felt a sense of concern and a worry that his desire to go to Eros was imposing on his family\u2019s happiness and well-being. He was questioning whether it was \u201cfair\u201d to ask them to abandon their familiar life.\n\nA. He felt selfish for making the family join along in his endeavors to a new planet. - This is partially true, as he admits to imposing his dream, but the core of his concern is about the impact on his family, not his own selfishness.\nB. He ultimately knew that the mission would fail. - The passage doesn\u2019t suggest he doubted the mission\u2019s success; he\u2019s driven by his dream.\nC. The family was forced to leave Earth even though they did not want to leave. - The passage doesn\u2019t convey this; it suggests the family *wanted* to go, albeit with some reservations.\nD. He knows that moving to Eros is not the best decision for the family. - While he expresses concern, he\u2019s still driven by his dream and doesn\u2019t fully acknowledge it might not be the *best* decision for them.\n\n**D**"

Pop frequently seeks Dick\u2019s advice and relies on him for technical tasks \u2013 checking declension, trajectory, and working on the hypatomic.  Pop acknowledges Dick's skill and experience directly, praising him and assigning him crucial jobs.  Bobby, on the other hand, is often dismissed with curt instructions (\u201cShut up, kid, you\u2019re enough to wake the dead\u201d) and his eagerness is seen as a hindrance. He is relegated to observing and following instructions rather than actively participating in complex repairs or decisions. There's no indication of Bobby making errors or lacking cooperation.\n\nConsidering these observations, the most plausible reason is that Dick is more mature and takes the journey seriously.\n\nB"

The family\u2019s focus is on securing necessities for survival on Eros, and the ruined supplies highlight the immediate need for replacements.
