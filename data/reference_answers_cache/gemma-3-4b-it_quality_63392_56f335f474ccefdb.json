However, the story quickly shifts focus to Kal-Jmar and its secrets.\n\n2.  **Tate's Proposition:** Tate specifically mentions wanting to go to Kal-Jmar and needing a guide. Syme recognizes a potential opportunity \u2013 a lucrative adventure.\n\n3.  **Syme\u2019s Instinct:** Throughout the encounter, Syme displays a keen intuition, feeling a \u201chunch\u201d that something big was coming. He\u2019s not passively accepting; he\u2019s assessing the situation and recognizing a valuable prospect.\n\n4.  **Lack of Alternatives:** Syme is an outlaw, and his life is precarious. He\u2019s actively seeking a way out, but the Kal-Jmar mission presents a far more enticing and potentially rewarding path.\n\n5. **The story suggests he didn't respect Tate:** The encounter reveals that Tate is not a refined or influential figure, and Syme doesn't display any admiration for him.\n\nConsidering these points, the best answer is that Syme accepted the mission because he had no plan for his life and jumped on the adventure.\n\nD"

The Martian reveals that the Martians weren't trying to gain anything from Earthlings \u2013 they simply avoided contact because they perceived humans as inferior and potentially destructive. This implies that Tate\u2019s entire motivation for seeking Kal-Jmar \u2013 the promise of treasure and conquest \u2013 was based on a false premise. The Martians weren't guarding a hidden fortune; they were actively concealing their existence to protect themselves.\n\nConsidering the options:\n\n*   **A. He learned Kal-Jmar didn\u2019t contain secrets and treasures:** This is a strong possibility. Tate\u2019s excitement centered around the potential wealth of the city.\n*   **B. He learned the creatures of Kal-Jmar would kill him instantly:** While a threat existed, it wasn't the primary reason for his dejection. He survived the encounter.\n*   **C. He learned Kal-Jmar was a fictional place:** The text explicitly states Kal-Jmar *is* a real place, making this incorrect.\n*   **D. He was told the Kal-Jmar dome sensed Earthling DNA and would explode his body on entry:** This is a red herring \u2013 it\u2019s a detail about the dome's defenses, not the reason for Tate's sadness.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is A.\n\nA"

He\u2019s motivated by escaping Mars and obtaining an identity card to facilitate travel. He\u2019s shown a disregard for human life, readily killing the young spaceman he encounters. The story focuses heavily on his pursuit of Kal-Jmar and the atmospheric catalyst. The final lines reveal he\u2019s simply looking for a freighter berth, suggesting a pragmatic, self-serving goal of escaping and finding work.

There\u2019s no immediate bonding or prior relationship.\n2. **Syme\u2019s Motivation:** Syme is a wanted outlaw desperately seeking a way off Mars. He\u2019s primarily focused on acquiring a spaceman\u2019s identity card.\n3. **Tate\u2019s Motivation:** Tate is on a mission to reach Kal-Jmar and is seeking a guide.\n4. **Collaboration:** They agree to work together to reach Kal-Jmar, with Tate relying on Syme\u2019s knowledge and experience.\n5. **Syme\u2019s Use of Tate:** Syme seems to be somewhat manipulative, using Tate\u2019s desire for Kal-Jmar to his advantage. Syme casually mentions that he \"might as well enjoy himself,\" and the story emphasizes Syme's desire to be seen with a companion for safety.\n6. **Tate's Vulnerability:** Tate displays a degree of naivete and trust, which Syme exploits. Tate readily accepts Syme\u2019s explanations and doesn\u2019t immediately question Syme\u2019s motives.\n\nConsidering these points, none of the options fully capture the dynamic.

He\u2019s quickly overwhelmed and realizes he\u2019s in a desperate situation.\n2. **Turning Point:** The key moment is Syme\u2019s sudden burst of furious action \u2013 \u201cHe put everything he had into one mighty, murderous effort.\u201d This wasn\u2019t a calculated strategy, but a primal, instinctive reaction fueled by rage.\n3. **Rapid Elimination:** He describes \"mowing down the massed natives in great swaths,\" \u201cswift, terrible slashes,\u201d and \u201croaring at the top of his powerful lungs.\u201d This indicates a whirlwind of violent, almost frantic attacks.\n4. **Tate\u2019s Role:** Tate is described as being \u201cflattened against the wall behind him,\u201d suggesting he was unable to actively participate in the fight.\n5. **Weapon Advantage:** While he uses a ray gun, it\u2019s implied that it\u2019s a desperate measure rather than a primary advantage. The focus is on his raw physical power and relentless aggression.\n\nConsidering these points, the most accurate explanation is that Syme\u2019s victory was due to a combination of raw power and a sudden, overwhelming burst of aggression.\n\nA"
