They worked together for 6 weeks:** The text states the narrator and stoker \"lived three feet away from him for a month and a half,\" and they \"shipped with him.\" This suggests a longer working relationship than 6 weeks.\n*   **B. They fought in the war together:** The narrator explicitly states that he and the stoker had \"not ... served in the combat arms\" and that the stoker\u2019s war \u201chadn\u2019t been the same as ours.\u201d\n*   **C. They met in a bar on Earth:** The story mentions a hypothetical scenario where the stoker might have walked to the Earth-Mars shuttle field from a bar, but they did not meet in a bar.\n*   **D. The narrator was the stoker's boss:** The narrator was the \"Second Officer\" and MacReidie was the \"First Officer.\" The stoker was a stoker working under their supervision.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\nA"

Mac's worry is about the stoker's potential instability, but the uniform is the trigger for that worry.\n*   **Option B:** The text explicitly states that \"The Marines did Earth's best dying\" and that very few were left alive. Mac's concern stems from this fact\u2014that the stoker may be seeking some kind of retribution. This aligns well with the text's description of the stoker's look and Mac\u2019s interpretation of it.\n*   **Option C & D:** The narrator and Mac do not realize they fought with the stoker in the same unit. The text says they hadn't served in combat arms.\n\nTherefore, the significance of the Marine uniform lies in the fact that the Marines suffered heavy losses during the war, and Mac is worried the stoker might be seeking revenge.\n\nB"

Hard working:** The text explicitly states he \"saved the ship,\" fixed a flashover, and worked with \"one arm dead,\" demonstrating a strong work ethic.\n*   **B. Resilient:** He kept going, shipping with different crews and adapting to new situations, showing resilience. His ability to withstand the harsh conditions of the engine room also points to resilience.\n*   **C. Aggressive:** The text contrasts him with veterans who engaged in drunken fights. He's described as \"quiet\" and \"walking casually,\" suggesting a lack of aggression. The narrator even expresses slight fear of him initially, but not because of aggression.\n*   **D. Quiet:** The narrator frequently mentions his quiet nature, both in his movements and speech. He sings loudly, but that's portrayed as a sign of camaraderie, not aggression.\n\nTherefore, the word that doesn't fit is \"Aggressive.\"\n\nC"

Keep your friends close and your enemies closer:** While there's some initial suspicion and tension, this isn't the central idea. The story isn't primarily about strategic relationships.\n*   **B. War changes people:** This is a strong contender. The story explicitly describes the lasting impact of war on the stoker and, to a lesser extent, the narrator and MacReidie. The stoker's actions and demeanor are directly linked to his wartime experiences. The narrator reflects on the changes in himself as well.\n*   **C. The effects of war last through generations:** The story focuses on the immediate aftermath of the war and individual experiences rather than multi-generational consequences.\n*   **D. Simple actions can mend deep conflict:** The stoker's actions *do* contribute to improved relations, but the story doesn't frame it as a simple solution to a deep conflict. It's a gradual shift influenced by many factors.\n\nGiven the emphasis on the stoker's changed state and the lingering effects of the war on the characters, option B is the most fitting theme.\n\nB"

We moved out beyond Centaurus, and Sirius, and then we met the Jeks, the Nosurwey, the Lud.\" This indicates a conflict or series of conflicts where humans were defeated. It continues, \"We were smashed back like mayflies in the wind.\" This confirms they were losing. Following this, \"The Jeks and the Lud and the Nosurwey returned to their own affairs, and we knew they would leave us alone so long as we didn't bother them.\" This describes a situation where the alien races have subdued humanity, but allow them to exist as long as they don't cause trouble. This fits the description of a truce or a state of being left alone after defeat.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\nA"

Humans are \"beaten\" and forced to submit to the \"wiser, gentler races in the stars.\" However, after surrender, the aliens allow humans to retain their solar system and engage in limited trade. This implies a degree of tolerance, not outright hostility.\n\nThe text emphasizes that humans learned to \"like\" and be \"grateful\" for this arrangement. They accepted it as a \"fantastically generous gift.\" The humans refrained from causing trouble, and the aliens, in turn, left them alone.\n\nLater in the story, the stoker\u2019s actions seem to subtly improve the relationship, leading to increased trade and better treatment for humans. The aliens begin to treat humans with \"respect.\"\n\nThe text *does not* describe humans and aliens living in communities together (eliminating D). Communication exists, and it's steadily improving. The initial relationship wasn't cordial, but it evolves into one of respectful coexistence (eliminating A and C).\n\nB."

He explicitly states he wants to \"stoke\" and finds satisfaction in that work.\n*   **B. He wants to work:** This aligns with the stranger's stated reason: \"I'll stoke.\" He's looking for a job, and stoking is the only position available. This seems to be his primary, straightforward motivation.\n*   **C. He is desperate:** There's no explicit mention of desperation. He seems calm and collected.\n*   **D. He is bored:** The text doesn't suggest boredom as a factor.\n\nBased on the evidence, the most accurate answer is that he wants to work. The narrator's reflections later suggest a deeper, more philosophical reason, but his immediate action is to accept the offered work.\n\nB"

No, he could cause trouble with other races:** The text explicitly states Mac's concern that the stranger, being a veteran of the war and a marine, could \"start something\" with the Jeks, potentially leading to conflict and endangering Earth. This aligns with the passage.\n*   **B. Yes, he is a great stoker:** They don't know this initially. His skill as a stoker is demonstrated later, not at the outset.\n*   **C. Yes, he was a respected marine:** While the narrator acknowledges the stranger's Marine background, it doesn't equate to trust. In fact, it creates apprehension.\n*   **D. No, he could cause trouble on the ship:** While this is a potential concern, Mac's primary worry is the broader implications of his actions towards other races, not just on the ship.\n\nBased on the text, option A best captures their initial distrust and the reason for it.\n\nA"

He earned respect:** The text reveals he spoke to the Jek captain and revealed a shared history (\"I was at this planet in '39...\"). This suggests a recognition and respect based on past acquaintance, not necessarily earned through actions.\n*   **C. They will allow anyone on their ship:** The text indicates the Jeks were initially cautious and questioned him. This contradicts the idea that they allow anyone on board.\n*   **D. He tricked them:** There's no indication of deception in the text. He was straightforward in his request to speak with the captain and revealed a shared history.\n\nGiven the evidence, the most plausible explanation is that the Jeks allowed him on board because of his shared past with them.\n\nB"

It's been a while since I worked with one, but I think I'll make out all right, even with the screwball way they've got it set up.\" This suggests he's looking for work and enjoys the challenge of working with a new type of engine.\n*   **B. He is going to sabotage their nuclear drive:** There's absolutely no indication of sabotage. He expresses interest in working on the drive, not destroying it.\n*   **C. He does not like his own people:** While he's a veteran of a losing war, he doesn't express dislike for humanity. He seems to be seeking something else.\n*   **D. He wants to join the winning side:** While the Jeks are the \"winning\" side, the story emphasizes his desire for a new experience and a job, rather than a political alignment.\n\nThe strongest evidence points to a desire for travel and work.\n\nA"

He just worked and traveled:** The story explicitly states that the narrator doesn't know what the stranger *did* to improve relations, but his consistent work and travels amongst different alien species seemed to be a factor.\n*   **C. He did all of these things:** This is the most comprehensive answer, encompassing both the act of humanizing the race and simply existing and working among the aliens.\n*   **D. He proved the value of humanity:** While possible, the story doesn't state that the stranger actively *proved* human value. It's more implied through his interactions.\n\nThe text implies that the stranger's actions, essentially just living and working amongst different alien species, had an unexpectedly positive impact. This combination of humanizing the race and demonstrating a willingness to integrate likely contributed to improved relations.\n\nC"

Do not lose yourself in defeat.** This aligns strongly with the story. Humanity initially wallows in defeat and self-pity, believing themselves unfit. The stoker's actions, though seemingly simple, contribute to a shift in perspective and a subsequent recovery.\n*   **C. Travel as much as possible.** While the stoker travels extensively, the story doesn't explicitly promote travel as a universal lesson. It's a consequence of his actions, not the core message.\n*   **D. Do your job without causing trouble.** The stoker initially seems to cause trouble (jamming the intercom), but ultimately his work ethic and willingness to do his job, combined with his unassuming nature, leads to positive change. However, it\u2019s not the central theme.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B.\n\nB"
