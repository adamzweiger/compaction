This he clasped on Na's wrist. 'All men will know now that you are the mate of Ro,' he whispered.\"\n\nThe key phrase here is \"the mate of Ro.\" This implies a significant, committed relationship, stronger than just dating. It's presented as a public declaration that all men will recognize. Combat mates is unlikely, and the story doesn't suggest marriage. Engagement is the closest meaning conveyed.\n\nA"

They emit flames:** The text doesn't mention the Oans emitting flames.\n*   **C. The strength of their arms:** While Martians acknowledge the strength of the red men's arms, the text doesn't highlight the Oans' arm strength as an advantage.\n*   **D.

He drove a hard fist into the stout man's face.\" This aggressive action suggests a personal, emotional reaction rather than a leadership or protective one.\n*   The text also mentions, \"Grimm sneered. 'Okay, I'll go with the red man. But when we meet again, it will be a different story.'\" This reinforces a sense of animosity and a desire for future conflict stemming from this specific situation.\n*   Considering these clues, the most logical reason for Grimm's annoyance is jealousy because he is in love with Charlotte.\n\nD"

Carlson and Charlotte have a clear romantic interest, which is not portrayed as a \"difficulty\" in understanding signals.\n*   **B. In their eagerness to enter into combat situations.** Ro is definitely eager for combat, motivated by revenge. However, the passage doesn't suggest Carlson and Grimm share this same eagerness; Grimm is even reluctant to participate initially.\n*   **C. In their need to establish themselves as the more dominant male through physical prowess.** The passage depicts a brief physical altercation between Carlson and Grimm, implying a rivalry driven by romantic interest rather than a general need to prove dominance.\n*   **D. In their attachment to and rivalry over women.** The passage explicitly mentions Carlson and Grimm's rivalry over Charlotte, and Ro observes this with amusement, drawing a comparison to Martian customs. Ro recognizes this behavior as familiar, indicating a shared experience in matters of the heart.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is D.\n\nD"

Their typical mode of communication:** The text explicitly states the humans use telepathy (\"speaking with their minds\"), while the Martians communicate through more traditional means (and Ro initially struggles to understand the concept). This *is* a difference.\n*   **B. The importance of tracking time:** The humans have a system of years (2200), while the Martians don't seem to have a similar concept. This *is* a difference.\n*   **C. The dynamic between males and females:** The text mentions Martian men being stern with women and a custom of kissing and giving an armband to signify a woman as a mate. The humans also have relationship dynamics, with Carlson and Charlotte planning to marry, and a bit of tension with Grimm. While there are nuances, the general dynamic seems comparable.\n*   **D. Their marriage ceremony:** The Martians have a simple tradition of a kiss and gifting an armband, while the humans have more formal, legalistic concepts (Hollywood, legality). This *is* a difference.\n\nTherefore, the only option that doesn't represent a difference is C.\n\nC"

The turning point comes after Carlson discusses marriage customs on Earth, mentioning Hollywood and the complexities of marriage and divorce. Ro then laughs and says, \"Now I'm not so sure.\" This suggests Ro's perspective shifted because he recognized the humans' technological advancements hadn't necessarily made their social customs superior or simpler \u2013 in fact, they seemed more complicated and potentially problematic.\n\nNow let\u2019s examine each option:\n\n*   **A:** This aligns perfectly with the passage's final exchange about the complexities of marriage on Earth versus the Martian custom of a simple kiss and promise.\n*   **B:** While Martians are strong, the passage doesn't focus on their physical strength as the reason for Ro's change of opinion.\n*   **C:** The passage doesn't explicitly discuss Martians' public displays of affection versus human suppression of affection.\n*   **D:** While there's a brief rivalry scene between Carlson and Grimm, it\u2019s not the core reason for Ro\u2019s shift in thinking. The conversation about marriage is the immediate catalyst.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A.\n\nA"

Telepathy takes less concentration than speaking aloud.** While potentially true, this isn't a *strong* motivator for widespread development. It's a minor convenience.\n*   **B. Telepathy is ideal for keeping sensitive information secret, since it cannot be accidentally overheard.** This is a very compelling reason. The ability to communicate privately and securely is a powerful incentive, especially for those in positions of power or with valuable secrets.\n*   **C. Telepathy enables communication across language barriers.** This is also a good motivator, fostering understanding and cooperation between different groups.\n*   **D. Telepathy eliminates the misunderstanding that comes with words.** This is an idealistic and potentially unrealistic goal. Misunderstandings often stem from more than just the words themselves (tone, context, etc.).\n\nConsidering the potential benefits, maintaining secrecy (option B) likely held the most significant driving force behind developing such a complex ability.\n\nB"
