Dorr is now in a position to make the riddance permanent, suggesting a desire for Asa's harm.\n3. Asa suspects that Dorr is trying to get rid of him, and Dorr is willing to leave Asa stranded on Jordan's Planet without any help.\n\nConsidering these points, the relationship between Asa and Dorr seems to be one of mutual distrust and animosity, driven by a struggle for dominance over the Slider egg supply and the Hazeltyne company.\n\n**C**"

If the pay range was lower, his financial motivation would be reduced, but his desire to study the Slider eggs and cause trouble for Hazeltyne might still be strong enough to keep him from opting for prison.\n\nHowever, the text suggests that Asa was willing to take a risk for a significant financial reward, and a lower pay rate might make the risk less worthwhile. He might have considered other options, such as becoming a changeling at another planet with a higher pay rate.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is:\n\nC"

The text does not mention that a frog-shaped body wards off Sliders, so option A is unlikely.\n2. The text describes the terrain on Jordan's Planet as being made of mud and water, which would be easier to navigate with a body adapted to swimming and jumping like a frog. This makes option B a strong candidate.\n3. The text does not mention that the frog shape is used to prevent prisoners from escaping, so option C is unlikely.\n4. The text does not suggest that the frog shape is intended to be grotesque or punitive, so option D is unlikely.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely answer is:\n\nB"

The native creatures, the Sliders, are described as a danger to humans, and they are attracted to the eggs and the presence of humans.\n4.

Furston puts Asa and Kershaw through a series of exercises to teach them how to use their new bodies and equipment, and explains the rules and dangers of being a muck man.\n\nAsa and Kershaw work together to find a Slider egg, and Asa uses his new skills to fend off a Slider attack.

Harriet's tone seems to be more assertive and critical towards Dorr.\n3. Dorr's response to Harriet's argumentative tone is a polite dismissal, which implies that he may not be taking her concerns seriously.\n4. Harriet seems to be more concerned about the way the company is being run, rather than Dorr's personal behavior or mannerisms.\n\nBased on these points, it seems that Harriet's primary concern is with Dorr's management style and the way he is running the Hazeltyne company, which suggests that she believes he is not competent to do so.\n\nA."

The job of a muck man on Jordan's Planet is extremely hazardous, as evident from Asa's experiences with the Sliders.\n2. The company is willing to offer a relatively high pay of $25 per day, which suggests that the work is not only difficult but also valuable.\n3. The prisoners are given a chance to shorten their sentences by bringing in eggs, which implies that the company is motivated by a desire to benefit from their labor.\n4. The company's primary goal is to collect Slider eggs, which are a valuable and rare commodity.\n\nConsidering these points, the most logical reason for the company to employ prisoners as muck men is that they are desperate enough to take on the dangerous job to lower their prison sentence.\n\nB"

This suggests that after serving his sentence, Asa will be free to leave the planet and use his earnings.\n\nGiven this information, it seems likely that after their sentence is served, a changeling can choose to stay on their new planet or return to Earth.\n\nD."

He is instructed by Furston, a muck man and warden, to eat a few berries from a native vine.\n3. Asa eats the berries and immediately vomits.\n\nConsidering these points, the purpose of Furston's instruction is not to help Asa develop an immunity to toxic plant life (C) or to provide him with energy to hunt Slider eggs (D), as Asa's reaction to the berries is adverse. It's also not to demonstrate the impossibility of escaping imprisonment and seeking refuge on Jordan's Planet (B), as the berries are not a test of his ability to survive on the planet. The correct answer is to help him acclimate to his new changeling diet (A), as the berries are a native plant on Jordan's Planet and the reaction to them serves as a reminder that everything on the planet is toxic to humans."
