The total dose is calculated as 4 * 1800mg which is equal to 7200 mg. The available options do not match the real value. However, we need to select the option closest to the real value.\n\nLet's re-examine the question more closely. The question asks for the \"cumulative dose\" given that the patient received 4 cycles.

It's more accurate to look for the number of mg per dose and then consider how many doses were given.\n\nNow let's look for an option close to 7200mg:\n\nNone of the options are exact but let's review to make sure we haven't missed anything. The provided text does not mention specific units but it\u2019s given as mg. Hence, we will keep the answer closest to the original number which is 1800mg. It mentions the cumulative doses of 1800mg for the first 4 cycles.\n\nTherefore, considering the options and our calculation, B appears to be the best answer, as it closely aligns with the total dose (assuming it's the cumulative dose across the 4 cycles).\n\nB"

Specifically, there was evidence of increasing barrier disturbance, a new nodular enhancement, and residual contrast-absorbing tumor portions.\n3. **Rationale for Change:** Given the progression of the tumor despite FOLFIRINOX, a change in treatment strategy was necessary. FOLFIRINOX is a potent chemotherapy regimen, but it doesn\u2019t always lead to complete tumor control, especially in advanced cancers.\n4. **Gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel:** The shift to gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel is a common alternative chemotherapy combination used in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.

MGMT promoter: Non-methylated - The report does not mention the MGMT promoter status.\n*   E. CDKN2A/B: Deleted - The report states \u201cCDKN2A/B: Deleted\u201d.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nC"
