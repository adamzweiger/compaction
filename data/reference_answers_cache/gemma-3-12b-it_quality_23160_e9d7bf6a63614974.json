He wants to be recruited by NASA:** While he's showing the Air Force how to build manifolds, the story suggests this is a consequence of his actions, not his initial goal.\n*   **B. He wants to get rid of his old cars that aren't selling to make space for cars that he can sell:** The story explicitly states he was sending the cars \"up\" because he needed the space and no one was buying them. He wants to clear out his yard for more profitable Fords and Chevys.\n*   **C. He wants to interfere with the Russians' spacecrafts:** While his actions inadvertently affect the Russians, it's not his intention.\n*   **D. He wants to become famous and be in the newspaper:** The story implies he isn't seeking fame, but rather is surprised by the attention.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is B.\n\nB"

He is bored and starts tinkering around:** The story doesn't present his actions as stemming from boredom.\n*   **B. He gets a notice from the city that he needs to clean up his yard:** The text doesn't mention any such notice.\n*   **C. He likes the old cars too much to destroy them. He wants to get rid of them, but also keep them intact:** This aligns with the text, which states, \"He'd broken no laws in all the years he\u2019d been in the United States...Wasn't the air free, like the seas? People dumped things into the ocean.\u201d He wants to be rid of them, but not destroy them and seems to value them.\n*   **D.

He's portrayed as a practical, resourceful man running a junkyard.\n*   **B. Clever:** Solomon demonstrates ingenuity and resourcefulness by figuring out how to launch cars into space using basic mechanical principles. This aligns with the definition of clever.\n*   **C. Na\u00efve:** While he's initially unaware of the potential implications of his actions, the text doesn't paint him as generally na\u00efve.\n*   **D. Untrustworthy:** There's no indication that Solomon is intentionally deceptive or untrustworthy. He's honest about his actions, even when questioned.\n\nTherefore, the best descriptor is \"clever.\"\n\nB"

Likewise, the cars are old and worn out.** The passage explicitly states Solomon is a \"tired\" man with \"tired bones\" and describes the cars as being in \"silent agony,\" \"rusted,\" and having \"broken wheels.\" This is a strong parallel.\n*   **B. He is energetic and full of life. Likewise, the cars are shiny and fast.** The passage portrays Solomon as weary, not energetic. The cars are described as wrecks, not shiny and fast. This option is incorrect.\n*   **C. They both represent nostalgia for the golden days.** While there's a hint of nostalgia, it's not the central comparison. The primary similarity is their state of being.\n*   **D. They are both past their prime.** This is a valid interpretation, but \"old and tired\" (option A) more directly captures the details from the text.\n\nTherefore, option A best reflects the comparison drawn in the passage.\n\nA"

The best inventions are made by accident.** While Solomon's invention was somewhat accidental, the story emphasizes his ingenuity and understanding of engines, not just pure chance. So, this isn't the primary theme.\n*   **B. There is great value in ordinary things and people.** Solomon, an unassuming junk yard owner, creates something extraordinary. The story champions his resourcefulness and demonstrates that brilliance can be found in unexpected places. This aligns well with the narrative.\n*   **C. Some things are not salvageable.** While the story deals with old, broken cars, the focus isn't on their unsalvageability but on Solomon's repurposing of them.\n*   **D. Junk is difficult to get rid of.** This is a minor plot point, but not a central theme.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting theme is that value and brilliance can be found in ordinary people and things.\n\nB"

The description of Solomon's methods and the escalating confusion contribute to the humor.\n*   **Serious:** While there's humor, the story touches on serious themes like Cold War tensions, technological competition, and government reactions to perceived threats. However, these are largely presented through a lens of satire and absurdity, rather than with genuine gravitas.\n*   **Dramatic:** There aren't significant dramatic elements like heightened emotional stakes or intense conflict.\n*   **Suspenseful:** The initial mystery of the orbiting cars creates some suspense, but it quickly gives way to humor and absurdity.\n\nGiven the overwhelming presence of humor stemming from the bizarre premise and reactions, the most appropriate answer is A.\n\n\n\nA"

They were trying to understand *how* these cars got into space, not necessarily *why* they wanted to do it themselves.\n\nThe text reveals they were attempting to replicate the American feat, implying a competitive motivation. They couldn't figure out how to control the vacuum and pressure needed, suggesting they were trying to match the American technology, not utilize it for strategic purposes. Getting revenge isn't explicitly stated. The text does not say they didn't want to, so A is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most logical answer is that they were trying to compete with the Americans.\n\nD"

He liked them too much:** The story states, \"No matter what beauties they were to Solomon's prejudiced eyes; missing fenders, rusted body panels, broken wheels and rotted woodwork bespoke the utter impossibility of restoration.\" This suggests he didn't see them as valuable enough to restore, not that he cherished them.\n*   **B. He didn't have the means:** The text doesn't indicate a lack of tools or ability to destroy the cars. He was a mechanic and had a junkyard.\n*   **C. They were worth too much:** The text states they were difficult to sell and \"no one would buy\" them. So they weren't worth much.\n*   **D. He was not allowed:** There is no mention of any restrictions preventing him from destroying the cars.\n\nThe key reason is that he couldn't sell them and thought sending them into space was a unique solution.\n\nA"

The text states: \"He\u2019d read of scientists in block houses when they shot rockets and was taking no chances. [...] He held the cords in one calloused hand, a burning match in the other so he could watch the Essex.\" This indicates the matches were used for visibility, helping him see and manage the cords connected to the shingle control panels.

People dumped things into the ocean.\" This shows he initially didn't believe he was doing anything wrong.\n3. **Further review:** Later, when confronted, he \"wondered if he'd done wrong to send cars into the sky.\" He expresses fear of being locked up and losing his business.\n4. **Match to options:**\n   * A is incorrect; he doesn't initially worry about the Russians.\n   * B is correct; he justifies his actions by observing that others were sending things into space.\n   * C is correct; he does express worry about getting in trouble.\n   * D is incorrect; there's no indication he saw this as patriotic.\n\nSince both B and C are correct, we need to consider the *primary* reason he felt his actions were permissible. His initial justification was that everyone else was doing it.\n\nB"
