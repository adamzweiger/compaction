I was on the floor next to an unpadded acceleration couch\u2014the kind the Terrestrial Space Arm installs in seldom-used lifeboats. There were three more couches, but no one in them. I tried to sit up. It wasn't easy but, by applying a lot more will-power than should be required of a sick man, I made it. I took a look at my left arm. Baked. The hand was only medium rare, but the forearm was black, with deep red showing at the bottom of the cracks where the crisped upper layers had burst.... There was a first-aid cabinet across the compartment from me. I tried my right leg, felt broken bone-ends grate with a sensation that transcended pain. I heaved with the other leg, scrabbled with the charred arm. The crawl to the cabinet dwarfed Hillary's trek up Everest, but I reached it after a couple of years, and found the microswitch on the floor that activated the thing, and then I was fading out again.... I came out of it clear-headed but weak. My right leg was numb, but reasonably comfortable, clamped tight in a walking brace.\u201d\n\nThe text explicitly mentions that he found the walking brace in the first-aid cabinet.\n\nD"

The text emphasizes that he was the *first recorded survivor* and that no one else was in the other couches. The lifeboat was his escape route from the rapidly disintegrating dreadnought.

He's initially confused, then hesitant, and finally dismissive, stating \u201cMaybe I oughta stick around. You know.\u201d This implies a feeling of unease and a desire to avoid involvement.\n\n3. **Guard's Reaction:** The guard's comment \u2013 \"You want I should drive in, sir?\" \u2013 suggests a guardedness and a questioning of Granthan\u2019s intentions.\n\n4. **Considering the Options:**\n   * **A. The authorities had circulated his picture:** While possible, the text doesn\u2019t mention this.\n   * **B. He could no longer control their minds:** This is a central point. Granthan\u2019s psychodynamic training gave him the ability to subtly influence people\u2019s thoughts \u2013 this ability was gone, or at least severely compromised, after his encounter with the Gool.\n   * **C. He was injured:** His injuries certainly hampered his ability to move and communicate effectively, but the core issue isn\u2019t simply his physical state. It\u2019s the *lack of influence* he possessed.\n   * **D. He did not understand people:** The text actually suggests the opposite \u2013 that Granthan *did* understand psychology and how people think.\n\nThe most significant reason for his difficulties is the loss of his ability to subtly influence people\u2019s minds. Without that, he was just a strange, injured man, and people reacted accordingly.\n\nB"
