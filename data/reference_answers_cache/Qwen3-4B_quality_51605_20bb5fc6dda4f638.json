The question is asking how many years passed between moving to Wisconsin and her son becoming a Konv.\n\nFirst, I need to find the relevant parts in the story. The story mentions that Mrs. Jamieson and her son moved to Wisconsin. Then, it says that her husband was killed in 1907, and she was in Bangkok then. Later, when her son Earl was fourteen, he became a Konv. \n\nWait, the text says: \"That was back in '07, on the eve of his departure for Alpha Centaurus; but she never spoke of this; and she was very careful not to move from place to place except by the conventional methods of travel.\" So the husband died in 1907. Then, the family moved to Wisconsin. The story mentions that when Earl was fourteen, he became a Konv. \n\nThe question is about the time between moving to Wisconsin and Earl becoming a Konv. The story says that Earl was fourteen when he became a Konv. The text also mentions that after her husband's death in 1907, they moved to Wisconsin. Then, the next event is when Earl was fourteen. \n\nWait, the text says: \"It happened to Earl one hot summer day when he was fourteen.\" So when was he fourteen? The story mentions that they had moved to Wisconsin after the husband's death in 1907. Then, the time between moving to Wisconsin and Earl being fourteen would be the number of years between the move and Earl's 14th birthday. \n\nBut how old was Earl when they moved to Wisconsin? The story says that when Earl was seven, they had just come to live in Wisconsin. So when Earl was seven, they moved. Then, when he was fourteen, that's seven years later. So the answer would be 7 years. \n\nSo the answer is C. 7.\n</think>\n\nC. 7"

The mother, Mrs. Jamieson, and her son Earl are Konvs, people with this special cylinder that allows instant travel. They plan to go to Alpha Centaurus, but there's a conflict with the Agents. \n\nIn the story, the mother explains that Earl needs to finish his studies and get ready for the journey. She tells him that when he's ready, they'll go. But later, there's a scene where they are almost caught by the Agents. The mother is worried about Earl's safety and the Agents' ability to track them. \n\nWait, in the end, the mother and Earl are confronted by Benjamin, who is part of the Konvs. But then the mother's power is taken away, and she's left with the Agents. However, the question is about why she didn't go with Earl. \n\nLooking back at the text, when Earl is ready for college, the mother says they'll go to Centaurus once he's done. But she also mentions that they need to be ready, and that Earl needs to study. However, later, the mother is afraid that the Agents might find them, and she's worried about Earl's safety. \n\nBut the actual answer might be in the part where the mother says, \"It's time to leave Earth.\" But she didn't go with Earl because she was afraid the Agents would find them. However, in the story, they do eventually leave, but the mother's power is taken away. Wait, the question is why she didn't go with Earl. \n\nWait, the mother and Earl are in the story, and they plan to go to Centaurus.

But in the story, she was determined to leave. However, in the end, the mother's power is taken away, and she is left behind. But the question is about why she didn't go with Earl. \n\nWait, the mother and Earl were supposed to go to Centaurus, but in the end, the mother is left behind. However, the answer options don't include that. The options are A. She hated the agents, B. She loved her husband, C. She loved her son, D. She was afraid to go. \n\nLooking back, the mother's motivation is to protect her son and avenge her husband. But in the end, she is afraid that the Agents will find them, so she decides to leave. However, the answer might be that she was afraid to go. But in the story, she was determined. \n\nWait, the mother says, \"It's time to leave Earth.\" But she is left behind because her power is taken. However, the question is why she didn't go with Earl. The answer is probably D. She was afraid to go. But according to the story, she was determined. \n\nAlternatively, the mother didn't go because she was afraid of the Agents, but in the story, she was determined to leave. However, the correct answer might be B.

She was afraid to go. But I need to check the story again. \n\nIn the story, the mother says, \"It's time to leave Earth.\" But she is left behind because her power is taken. However, the answer options don't include that. The correct answer is D. She was afraid to go.

The key part is when she says, \"When you have finished college, we will go to Centaurus.\" That's when they plan to leave Earth. \n\nEarlier, when Earl was 14, he disappeared and was taken by the Agents, but that was before they left Earth.

The options are A to D.\n\nLooking back at the story, Earl is a Konv, which is a person with a special cylinder that allows them to travel instantly. His mother, Mrs. Jamieson, explains that they are Konvs and that they have to deal with the Agents. \n\nIn the part where Earl is talking to his mother about his feelings, he mentions that he used to wish he was like others in high school. He talks about Lorane Peters, a girl he liked. He says he used to wish he was like the others, maybe to fit in or be normal. \n\nSo, the reason he wished to be human (or normal) is because he wanted to be like other people, perhaps to have friends or be accepted, rather than being different as a Konv. The answer would be D. He liked a girl, but the main reason is that he wanted to be normal, which is implied by his desire to be like others. However, the options don't have \"want to be normal\" but D is \"He liked a girl.\" Wait, in the text, he says he used to wish he was like the others, which might relate to having friends. But the specific mention is about Lorane Peters, the girl he liked. So maybe D is the answer. Alternatively, C is about not having friends. But the text says he was trying to be normal, which includes having friends. However, the direct answer from the story is that he wanted to be like others, which is not listed. But the options given are A, B, C, D. The correct answer based on the story is D, because he liked a girl and wanted to be normal. Wait, the text says: \"He could have killed many Agents. So she exhumed the money... He was clever and intelligent. He could kill many Agents. So she exhumed the money... He did not use the room that first year. He slept in the second bedroom. He did not mention his frustrated desires to be normal, not after the first attempt, but he persisted in his efforts to be so.\" Then later, he talks about Lorane Peters. So the answer is D. He liked a girl, which is why he wished to be human (normal). So the answer is D.\n</think>\n\nD"

The options are Stockholm, Wolf River, Siam, or Centaurus.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the story. From the context provided, there's a part where Earl disappears. The story mentions that Mrs. Jamieson finds a news item about Tom Palieu being killed by a Konv in Stockholm. Then she checks Earl's desk and finds a gun. Later, she's concerned about Earl's disappearance. \n\nWait, the story says that after Earl disappears, Mrs. Jamieson goes to Stockholm and finds clothes and makes inquiries. The slain man there was a Finnish Konv. Then, later, she finds out that Earl was in Bangkok talking to an Agent. But the question is about when he disappeared during college. \n\nLooking back at the text: \"One day he disappeared. Mrs. Jamieson was alarmed... The second day after his disappearance she found a small item. A Konv had raided the Agent's office in Stockholm...\" So Earl's disappearance happened before she went to Stockholm. But the answer options don't include Bangkok. Wait, the options are A. Stockholm, B. Wolf River, C. Siam, D. Centaurus.\n\nWait, the story mentions that Earl was in Bangkok when he talked to the Agent. But the disappearance happened during college. The story says that after he disappeared, she found out about the Stockholm raid. But the actual disappearance location isn't explicitly stated. However, the question is about where he went when he disappeared. The text says that after he disappeared, she went to Stockholm, but that's after he disappeared. The answer might be Stockholm (A) because that's where the raid happened, but the story doesn't explicitly say where he went. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Centaurus (D), but that's where they plan to go. \n\nWait, the story says that Earl was in Bangkok when he talked to the Agent. But the disappearance happened earlier. The text says: \"One day he disappeared. Mrs. Jamieson was alarmed. Had the Agents found him? She watched the papers daily for some word of Konvs being killed. The second day after his disappearance she found a small item. A Konv had raided the Agent's office in Stockholm...\" So the disappearance happened before the Stockholm raid. The answer options don't have Bangkok. The options are A. Stockholm, B. Wolf River, C. Siam, D. Centaurus. \n\nWait, the story mentions that Earl was in Bangkok when he talked to the Agent, but that was after he disappeared. The question is about where he went when he disappeared. The text doesn't explicitly state where he went, but the answer might be Stockholm because that's where the raid happened, but that's after he disappeared. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Siam (C), since the Agents were in Bangkok, which is Siam. But the story says that the Agents were in Bangkok, and Earl was there. However, the question is about where he went when he disappeared. The answer might be Siam (C), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Stockholm (A) because that's where the raid happened, but that's after. \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be B. Wolf River, but that's where the house is. The story says that the house is beside the Wolf River. But the answer is probably A. Stockholm because that's where the raid happened, but the text says that the raid was after he disappeared. Hmm. The question is a bit ambiguous. However, the correct answer based on the text is probably A. Stockholm, but I need to check again. \n\nWait, the story says that after Earl disappeared, Mrs. Jamieson found a news item about a Konv raiding in Stockholm. But that's after he disappeared. The actual disappearance location is not directly stated. However, the answer options might be based on the fact that he was in Bangkok when he talked to the Agent, but that's after the disappearance. The answer is probably A. Stockholm, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Siam (C), since Bangkok is in Siam. But the options are A. Stockholm, B. Wolf River, C. Siam, D. Centaurus. \n\nThe correct answer is A. Stockholm, because that's where the raid happened, and the story mentions that Earl was in Bangkok later, but the disappearance was before that. However, the answer might be A. Stockholm. Alternatively, the answer is C. Siam, since Bangkok is in Siam. But the text says that the raid was in Stockholm. So the answer is A. Stockholm.

The options are A through D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points of the story. Mrs. Jamieson is a Konv, someone with this special cylinder that allows instant travel. Her husband was one of the original Konvs, but he was killed by Agents. She and her son Earl are trying to escape Earth and go to Alpha Centaurus. \n\nThe story mentions that she had to hide her scar from the cylinder under her hair. But the main conflict seems to be her struggle against the Agents, who are after them. She's trying to protect her son and herself from the Agents. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA. Not understanding the Stinson Effect. But she does understand it, as she explains it to Earl. \n\nB. Raising her son alone. She does have to raise him, but the story emphasizes more on the conflict with the Agents. \n\nC. Making ends meet. They do manage to make ends meet with their small business. \n\nD. Hiding her scar. While she does hide the scar, the bigger problem is the Agents chasing them. \n\nBut the question is about the \"biggest problem.\" The story's main tension is the threat from the Agents, which is a bigger issue than hiding a scar. However, the answer options might not have that. Wait, the options given don't include the Agents as an option. Let me check again. The options are A to D as listed. \n\nWait, the story mentions that she had to hide her scar because of the cylinder, but the main problem is the Agents. However, the answer choices don't have that.

So perhaps the answer is D? Or maybe B? \n\nAlternatively, the story says that she had to hide her scar, but the bigger problem is the Agents. However, the answer options don't have the Agents. Therefore, maybe the answer is D, because the story mentions that she had to hide the scar, but the main problem is the Agents. But since the options don't have that, the answer might be D. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is B, raising her son alone. But the story shows that she's trying to protect her son from the Agents, which is a bigger problem. \n\nWait, the story's main conflict is the Agents. But since that's not an option, maybe the answer is D. The story says that she had to hide the scar, but the problem is that she couldn't reveal her Konv identity. However, the answer options don't have that. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is D. The story says that she had to hide the scar, but that's a detail. The main problem is the Agents, but since that's not an option, maybe the answer is D. \n\nBut looking back, the story says that the Agents are the main threat. However, the options don't have that. The answer must be among the given choices. The story says that she had to hide the scar, but that's a minor detail. The bigger problem is the Agents, but that's not an option. So maybe the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is B. But the story says she's not alone, she has her son. The problem is the Agents. So perhaps the answer is D. \n\nWait, the story says that the Agents are the main problem, but the answer choices don't have that. Therefore, the answer must be D. But that seems incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the answer is B. \n\nWait, the story says that she had to raise her son alone, but the main problem is the Agents. However, the answer options don't have that. The answer is D. \n\nHmm, I'm confused. Let me check the story again. The story's main conflict is the Agents. But the answer options don't have that. Therefore, the answer must be D.

The options are A through D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the story. The woman, Mrs. Jamieson, is a Konv, someone with a cylinder that allows instant space travel. She and her son Earl also have the cylinders. They plan to go to Centaurus. \n\nIn the story, there's a part where Earl is taken by Agents, and later, when they are about to leave Earth, they are confronted by Benjamin, who is part of the Konvs. Then, during the climax, the woman and Earl are captured by the Agents. But the key part here is when the woman's cylinder stops working. \n\nWait, the question says she didn't realize her cylinder no longer worked. The answer options are about why that happened. Let me check the story again. \n\nIn the part where they are with Benjamin, the woman and Earl are taken by the Agents.

Wait, in the story, when they were in the room with Benjamin, the woman's power was gone. The Agents came in, and she couldn't use her cylinder anymore. The reason given in the story is that Benjamin's hands were used to increase the power, but when they were captured, her power was gone. But why? \n\nWait, maybe the answer is related to her not using it as part of her disguise. The story mentions that she and Earl had to avoid using the cylinder because they were hiding their identities. But when they were in the room with Benjamin, they were able to use the cylinders. However, when the Agents came, she couldn't use her cylinder. \n\nWait, the story says that when they were with Benjamin, they took his hands to increase the power. Then, when the Agents came, she couldn't use her cylinder. But why? The answer might be that she had avoided using it as part of her disguise. Because earlier, she and Earl had to hide their Konv identities. But when they were with Benjamin, they were in the group, so maybe she used it. But when the Agents came, maybe the cylinder was disabled. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be that she had not wanted to go to Centaurus.

The reason given in the story is that Benjamin's hands were used to increase the power, but when the Agents came, her power was gone.

But the answer options don't mention that. \n\nLooking back at the options, option C is \"She had avoided using it as part of her disguise.\" The story mentions that she and Earl had to avoid using the cylinder to hide their identities. But when they were with Benjamin, they were part of the Konvs, so they would use it. However, when the Agents came, maybe the cylinder was disabled. But the question is why she didn't realize it was no longer working. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is C because she had been avoiding using it as part of her disguise. But when she was with Benjamin, she was using it. However, in the end, when the Agents came, her cylinder stopped working. The story says that when she and Earl were captured, her power was gone.

But the answer options don't mention that. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is C: She had avoided using it as part of her disguise. Because she and Earl had been hiding their Konv identities, so they didn't use the cylinder in public. But when they were with Benjamin, they were part of the Konvs, so they would use it. However, when the Agents came, maybe the cylinder was disabled. \n\nBut the question is why she didn't realize her cylinder no longer worked.

She killed an Agent who stayed in one of her cabins. The key part here is when she found out he was an Agent. \n\nIn the story, she accidentally discovers the Agent's badge while cleaning the cabin.

Her son, Earl, also becomes a Konv. They plan to escape Earth to Centaurus to live free from the Agents who hunt them.\n\nThe mother explains the history of the Konvs, the Agents, and her husband's death. She teaches Earl about their secret, the Agents' betrayal, and the need for revenge. There's a point where Earl meets Benjamin, another Konv, and they plan to leave Earth.\n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA. Agents are adversaries \u2013 The story definitely portrays the Agents as the enemy. The mother and son are fighting against them. But is this the main lesson?\n\nB. Not all Agents are bad people \u2013 In the story, the Agent in Bangkok helps Earl, showing that some Agents might not be purely evil. But the mother's main message is more about their struggle against the Agents.\n\nC. To study hard and follow his heart \u2013 The mother tells Earl to study for college so he can contribute to Centaurus. She emphasizes that he needs to be ready, not just avoid the Agents but also be prepared for the future. Also, there's a part where she talks about his desire to be normal, but the main lesson is about his role in the Konv community.\n\nD. To become an engineer so he is needed on Centaurus \u2013 The mother mentions that Stinson is a physicist, Benjamin a metallurgist, and Straus a doctor. She tells Earl to study hard because when they go to Centaurus, they need people with different skills. But is this the main lesson? It's part of the plan, but the mother's main message is more about their shared identity and the need to fight against the Agents.\n\nThe key moment is when the mother tells Earl that they need to leave Earth, and that he should study hard because when they get to Centaurus, they need people who can contribute. However, the mother also emphasizes that they must hate the Agents and seek revenge. But the question is about the most important lesson. The story ends with the mother and son leaving Earth, and the mother's final words are about the Agents and the need to leave. However, in the end, they are joined by Benjamin, and the mother's lesson is that they must work together, but the main lesson from the mother is that they must not be afraid, and that they have a purpose.

Even the great ones get sick.\" So she's encouraging him to study to be ready for Centaurus. But the main lesson is about their identity as Konvs and the need to fight against the Agents. However, the options don't include that. The answer options are A, B, C, D. The mother's main lesson is that they must not be afraid, and that they have a purpose. But the answer choices don't have that. The correct answer is C: To study hard and follow his heart. Because she tells him to study for college so he can contribute to Centaurus, and also that he should follow his heart, as in the part where he's conflicted about being normal. But the main lesson is that he must study to be ready for their mission. Alternatively, the answer might be C. But the story also shows that the mother wants him to hate the Agents.

From the text, Mrs. Jamieson's husband was a Konv, and Earl is her son. Benjamin is mentioned as one of the original Konvs, along with Stinson and Dr. Straus. \n\nIn the story, when Earl is in his room, he talks to his mother about his father's death.

This is a key moment. \n\nBut the crucial part is when Benjamin says, \"Your father was afraid you would be twins.\" This implies that Benjamin is related to Earl's father, E. Mason Jamieson. Since Benjamin is part of the Konv group, and he's talking about Earl's birth, it's likely that Benjamin is Earl's father. \n\nWait, but the story says that Mrs. Jamieson's husband was a Konv, and Earl is their son. If Benjamin is part of the Konv group, and he's talking about Earl's birth, maybe he's a close friend or a member of the original group. However, the line about the twins suggests that Benjamin is Earl's father. \n\nWait, the text says that Benjamin is one of the original Konvs, along with Stinson and Dr. Straus. The story mentions that Stinson left Earth for Alpha Centaurus with the others, and Benjamin was part of the group. \n\nBut when Benjamin arrives, he says, \"I remember when you were born,\" and mentions that Earl's father was afraid they would be twins. That would mean Benjamin is Earl's father. However, the story says that Earl's father was E. Mason Jamieson, and Mrs. Jamieson is his wife. So if Benjamin is Earl's father, that would mean he's married to Mrs. Jamieson. But in the story, Benjamin is a Konv, and he's part of the original group. \n\nWait, but in the story, when Mrs. Jamieson and Earl are talking, Benjamin is present. He says, \"I remember when you were born,\" which suggests he's a close friend or family member. However, the key line is when he says, \"Your father was afraid you would be twins.\" That implies that Benjamin is Earl's father. But that would mean that Benjamin is Earl's father, and Mrs. Jamieson is his mother. However, the story says that Earl's father was E. Mason Jamieson, and Mrs. Jamieson is his wife.

The text says that Benjamin is one of the original Konvs, along with Stinson and Dr. Straus. So, if Benjamin is part of the original group, and he's talking about Earl's birth, perhaps he's a close friend or a member of the group that includes Earl's father. \n\nBut the line about the twins suggests that Benjamin is Earl's father. However, the story says that Earl's father was killed by the Agents. So if Benjamin is Earl's father, then he would have been part of the group that left Earth. But in the story, Benjamin is present when they are about to leave, and he's part of the Konv group. \n\nWait, the story says that when Mrs. Jamieson and Earl are talking, Benjamin comes in and says, \"I remember when you were born,\" and that Earl's father was afraid they would be twins. That would mean that Benjamin is Earl's father. But that would make Benjamin the husband of Mrs. Jamieson, but the story says that Mrs. Jamieson's husband was E. Mason Jamieson. So this is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Benjamin is a close friend of Earl's father, and he's part of the Konv group. However, the line about the twins suggests that Benjamin is Earl's father.

The mother wants Earl to revenge his father's death, which was caused by the Agents. She also wants him to be prepared for their mission. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA. Singularly revenge of his father\u2019s death. The story mentions that the mother wants them to seek revenge, and she's planning to do it with Earl.

The mother talks about Earl needing to be ready for the mission, and she mentions that Stinson, Benjamin, and Straus have different roles. Straus is a doctor, so maybe Earl is supposed to become a doctor. But the mother's main hope is revenge. However, the story says she wants him to study hard for college, and after that, they go to Centaurus. So maybe C is a combination of revenge and healthcare training.

Alternatively, the answer could be A. But the story says that the mother's secret hope was that Earl would fully avenged his father's death. So A is correct.

The mother says, \"She did not mention her secret hope, that before they left Earth he would have fully avenged his father's death.\" So that's A.
