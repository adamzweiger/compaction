      "generated_text": "The story was about a former FBI agent describing Clinton slipping past his Secret Service detail at night to meet a woman. \n\nPeople questioned the story because they knew the Secret Service detail closely shadows the president, making it impossible for him to slip past them. \n\nClinton could not have gotten back home without being found out because the guards check all cars at the gate, especially those arriving at 4 a.m.\n\nA is not the reason people doubted the story, as it's the story itself that's being questioned, not the fact that Clinton cheats on his wife. \n\nB is not the reason, as Clinton-haters are not the ones who debunked the story, but rather people who know about White House security.\n\nD is not the reason, as the publication of the story in the Washington Times is not the reason it was debunked.\n\nSo, the correct answer is: C"

Previous presidents were able to get away with adultery because they had a more trusting relationship with the press, which didn't report on their personal affairs.\n2. While hiding was not always their primary concern, it was indeed easier for them to keep their affairs private.\n3. The Secret Service budget was not mentioned as a reason for them getting away with adultery.\n4.

Maids and butlers serve the family there, but the president and first lady ask them to leave when they want to be alone. \n\nThe article also mentions that the president and his friend get comfortable in one of the 14 bedrooms (or, perhaps, the billiard room) in the private quarters. \n\nTherefore, the president can meet a woman in the private quarters.\n\nB"

The Oval Office is not a suitable place for a discreet meeting, as it's not private. The tunnel between the White House and the Treasury Department is too well-guarded and would attract attention. \n\nThe article suggests that the best way for a president to sneak a woman into the White House is through the East gate, where the president can invite her to the private quarters without being detected by the press or many people. \n\nD"

They might be suspicious, but they would still have to follow the president's orders. \n\nThe president requests two agents and an unobtrusive sedan, which suggests that they are trying to keep the visit private. \n\nThe risks mentioned in this scenario are: \n\n- Gate guards may suspect something fishy when they see the car. \n- A reporter or passer-by could spy the president as the car enters and exits the White House. \n- The friend's neighbors might spot him, or they might notice the agents lurking outside her house. \n- A neighbor might call the police to report the suspicious visitors.\n\nConsidering these risks, the correct answer is: \nD"

Kennedy's affairs were not the reason for a significant increase in the number of Secret Service agents.\n3. Kennedy's actions did not lead to a protocol for the White House staff to follow regarding presidential affairs.\n\nBased on the information, Kennedy's actions did not directly impact the security measures in place for future presidents, so the correct answer is not C. The increase in the number of Secret Service agents occurred after the Kennedy era, so D is incorrect. The article does not mention a committee to monitor presidents' personal lives after Kennedy, so B is also incorrect. \n\nA is the most plausible answer, as it states that Kennedy was a faithful man, which implies that he did not make it more difficult for Clinton to have an affair by setting a precedent."

Making sure to pay off anyone involved or sees any indiscretions is not foolproof because it doesn't prevent the risk of leaks, blackmail, or the person involved deciding to reveal the affair.\n\nB. Simply having an affair and forgetting about the cover-up is not foolproof because it leaves the President vulnerable to being discovered by the press, Secret Service agents, or others who may stumble upon the affair.\n\nC. Getting his wife's permission is not a feasible or realistic option for a President to carry on an affair without consequences, as it would be a public scandal and potentially damage the President's reputation and marriage.\n\nD. Having a conjoining room with an aid, having the woman go to the aid's room, then come through the conjoining door, and returning the same way is the most plausible option described in the article as \"The Hotel Shuffle\" scenario.
