The hemorrhaged metastasis was resected in 2020, not 01/20. So this is incorrect.\n\nB. During one of her hospital stays, Mrs. Done was treated for a cystic metastasis, first detected in an emergency CT scan after a fall on 10/28/2020.\n- The text says: \"Incident on 10/28/2020: The patient had an unattended fall, resulting in a hematoma on the left forehead. An emergency CT scan showed no new fractures or acute hemorrhage but confirmed the presence of previously known cystic metastasis.\" So yes, a cystic metastasis was confirmed after a fall. This matches.\n\nC. The patient has undergone empyema removal due to an infection following her resection of a right frontal tumor, which took place in February 2020.\n- The text says: \"02/20 Excision of empyema\" \u2014 yes, empyema removal happened in February 2020. However, the resection of the right frontal tumor was in January 2020. The empyema removal followed the resection. This seems plausible, but the phrasing \"following her resection of a right frontal tumor\" is slightly off \u2014 the empyema was not due to the resection, but a separate complication. Still, it's close.\n\nD. Mrs. Done started combination immunotherapy with 60 mg Nivolumab and 200 mg Ipilimumab on 05/02/20.\n- The text says: \"05/02/20: Start of immunotherapy with Nivolumab\" \u2014 only Nivolumab, not the combination. The combination started on 05/26/20. So this is incorrect.\n\nE. The radiation therapy delivered during her hospitalization was a hypofractionated regimen involving five sessions each delivering a dose of 8 Gy for a cumulative total dose of 40 Gy.\n- The text says: \"five sessions, each delivering a dose of 6 Gy for a cumulative total dose of 30 Gy.\" So this is incorrect.\n\nBest match is B, as it directly and accurately reflects the event after a fall leading to detection of a known cystic metastasis.\n\nB"

Option A: Mitral valve replacement in March 2019 due to endocarditis with resection of infected tissue - this is mentioned in multiple texts (e.g., text_8, text_9), and the cause is linked to a Demers catheter infection. This is accurate.\n\n3. Option B: Stem cell mobilization in March 2019 due to RSV pneumonia - this is not accurate. The text states he had mobilization in July 2015, and stem cell transplant in November 2018-February 2019. VGPR was last noted in May 2018, not 2019. Also, treatment pause was due to endocarditis in March 2020, not 2019. So B is incorrect.\n\n4. Option C: Symptoms in November 2022 - the text mentions a clinical update in November 2022 with fatigue, shortness of breath, and bilateral edema. The echocardiogram showed reduced LVEF (35%), elevated BNP, and mild mitral regurgitation. This matches the text (text_9). So C is accurate.\n\n5. Option D: Increase in LK values in May 2020 leading to resumption of Daratumumab - this is mentioned in text_9. However, the increase was to 102 mg/L, not 150 mg/L. So D is incorrect.\n\n6.

Symptoms: Persistent fatigue, shortness of breath on minimal exertion, bilateral pitting edema in the lower extremities up to the mid-calf. Preliminary findings: Jugular venous distention, decreased breath sounds bilaterally with mild basilar crackles, S3 gallop on cardiac auscultation. Chest X-ray: Cardiomegaly with an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Mild pulmonary edema evident. Echocardiogram: Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35% (normal > 55%), mild mitral regurgitation.\"\n\nSo C is accurate.\n\nA is also accurate, but C is more specific to the clinical history and includes the exact numbers.\n\nBut the question is about the Multiple Myeloma diagnosis, and both are relevant.\n\nHowever, option C directly references a clinical event in the history that is specifically tied to the patient's condition and includes verifiable data.\n\nGiven that, and that A has a minor inaccuracy (the replacement was in March 2020, not 2019), let's check:\n\nIn text_8: \"Acute mitral valve endocarditis was diagnosed in March 2020. He underwent a re-operation for mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthesis (29 mm).\"\n\nSo A says March 2019 - that's incorrect.

Check which tests appear in chronological order:\n   - Initial diagnosis: PET brain MRI (08/2019) \u2192 this is PET-MRI\n   - First cMRI: 08/19 (post-resection)\n   - Second cMRI: 10/1/2019 (suspected recurrence)\n   - iMRI: used during resection procedures (08/19, 10/12/2019, 04/12/2020)\n   - PET-MRI: 01/2020 (follow-up)\n   - cMRI: multiple follow-ups (02/2021, 04/2021, 06/2021)\n   - CT: 09/15/2020 (for tumor recurrence)\n   - PET-CT: not mentioned anywhere\n\n3. Eliminate options with PET-CT: Option A, B, and E have PET-CT, which is not mentioned in any of the texts.\n\n4. Eliminate options with iMRI before cMRI: iMRI is used intraoperatively after resection, so it comes after cMRI.\n\n5. Option C starts with iMRI, which is not correct \u2014 iMRI is not a first-line diagnostic test.\n\n6. Option D starts with cMRI, which is plausible as a follow-up after initial PET-MRI.\n\n7. Option E starts with PET-MRI, which is correct for initial diagnosis, then cMRI, then CT, then PET-MRI again, then iMRI \u2014 which is plausible.\n\n8. However, in the text, the sequence is:\n   - PET-MRI (initial)\n   - cMRI (post-op)\n   - PET-MRI (follow-up)\n   - iMRI (during surgery)\n   - cMRI (follow-up)\n   - cMRI (follow-up)\n\n9. Option E has PET-MRI \u2192 cMRI \u2192 CT \u2192 PET-MRI \u2192 iMRI \u2192 cMRI \u2192 PET-CT \u2192 ... \u2014 PET-CT is not in the text.\n\n10. All options have PET-CT or iMRI out of order. But PET-CT is not in any of the texts.\n\n11. Recheck: PET-CT is not mentioned in any of the texts. So any option with PET-CT is invalid.\n\nTherefore, eliminate A, B, C, E (all have PET-CT or iMRI before cMRI or wrong order).\n\nOnly D has cMRI first \u2014 but it has PET-MRI before cMRI.\n\nWait \u2014 the correct sequence should start with PET-MRI (initial diagnosis), then cMRI (post-op), then PET-MRI (follow-up), then iMRI (during surgery), then cMRI (follow-up).\n\nOption E: PET-MRI \u2192 cMRI \u2192 CT \u2192 PET-MRI \u2192 iMRI \u2192 cMRI \u2192 PET-CT \u2192 ...\n\nBut PET-CT is not in the text.\n\nNone of the options are fully accurate.\n\nBut PET-CT is not in the text at all.\n\nTherefore, the only option that doesn't include PET-CT is C.\n\nC: iMRI < cMRI < PET-MRI < cMRI < CT < PET-MRI < cMRI < PET-CT < ...\n\nStill has PET-CT.\n\nAll options have PET-CT.\n\nThis suggests a possible error in the question or options.\n\nBut looking again \u2014 in the text, there is no PET-CT.\n\nTherefore, any option with PET-CT is invalid.\n\nAll options include PET-CT.\n\nSo the question may have a typo.\n\nBut in the text, the only imaging tests are:\n- PET-MRI\n- cMRI\n- iMRI\n- CT\n\nSo the correct sequence should be:\nPET-MRI \u2192 cMRI \u2192 cMRI \u2192 iMRI \u2192 cMRI \u2192 cMRI \u2192 cMRI \u2192 cMRI\n\nBut the options don't match.\n\nOption D: cMRI < PET-MRI < cMRI < iMRI < CT < PET-MRI < PET-CT < ...\n\nNo.\n\nOption E: PET-MRI < cMRI < CT < PET-MRI < iMRI < cMRI < PET-CT < ...\n\nStill has PET-CT.\n\nAll options have PET-CT.\n\nTherefore, likely a mistake in the options.\n\nBut if we must choose, and PET-CT is not in the text, then the correct option should not have it.\n\nBut all do.\n\nPerhaps the question meant PET-MRI instead of PET-CT.\n\nIn that case, option E has PET-MRI, cMRI, CT, PET-MRI, iMRI, cMRI, then PET-MRI, which is close.\n\nBut CT is before PET-MRI, which is not in the text.\n\nThe first imaging is PET-MRI.\n\nSo the correct order should start with PET-MRI.\n\nOnly options A, B, C, D, E start with PET-MRI or cMRI.\n\nOption A: PET-MRI \u2192 cMRI \u2192 cMRI \u2192 PET-MRI \u2192 iMRI \u2192 cMRI \u2192 cMRI \u2192 cMRI \u2192 cMRI\n\nThis has PET-MRI, cMRI, cMRI, PET-MRI, iMRI, cMRI, cMRI, cMRI, cMRI\n\nThis is plausible \u2014 PET-MRI first, then cMRI, then PET-MRI again, then iMRI, then cMRI.\n\nThe CT is missing.\n\nBut CT is mentioned in the text (09/15/2020).\n\nSo CT should be included.\n\nNo option has CT in the right place.\n\nAll options have PET-CT, which is not in the text.\n\nTherefore, I suspect a typo in the options.\n\nBut if I must choose, and PET-CT is not in the text, then any option with PET-CT is wrong.\n\nAll have PET-CT.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is not among them.\n\nBut the only option that has PET-MRI first and then cMRI is A.\n\nA has PET-MRI \u2192 cMRI \u2192 cMRI \u2192 PET-MRI \u2192 iMRI \u2192 cMRI \u2192 cMRI \u2192 cMRI \u2192 cMRI\n\nThis is close to the sequence.\n\nPET-MRI (initial), cMRI (post-op), cMRI (follow-up), PET-MRI (follow-up), iMRI (during surgery), cMRI (follow-up)\n\nThis matches.\n\nThe CT is missing, but it's not in the list of tests in the sequence.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is A.\n\nI will go with A.\n\nA"
