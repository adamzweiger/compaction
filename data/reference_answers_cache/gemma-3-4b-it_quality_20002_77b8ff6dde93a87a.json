Furthermore, he highlights that humans aren\u2019t consciously aware of these rules. The entire section on \u201cMisconception No. 1\u201d focuses on this flawed assumption about how genes operate.

However, the author argues that genes aren\u2019t conscious or intelligent; they simply trigger behaviors based on genetic predispositions.\n\n3. **The Paradox:** The crux of the argument is this: genes that originally evolved to favor love and altruism *within* families now spread through the entire human population because they\u2019ve become so widespread. This means that even helping strangers is, at a fundamental level, benefiting our own genetic lineage.\n\n4. **The Flaw in Selfishness:** The author highlights that these \u201cselfish\u201d genes fail spectacularly at being efficient because they\u2019re now spreading to *everyone*, including unrelated individuals.

They use the concept of kin selection to explain *why* humans exhibit these behaviors \u2013 essentially, it's a biological trick to propagate genes \u2013 but then sharply contrasts this with the idea that it *should* be considered a moral imperative. The anecdote about the praying mantises is a key example of this. The author explicitly states, \"to infer ought from is --to commit the 'naturalistic fallacy'--only leads to moral confusion.\" This highlights a crucial point: just because something *is* natural doesn\u2019t automatically make it ethical. They then argue that even seemingly innate behaviors like maternal bonding are driven by hormonal mechanisms, not a conscious, ethical choice.

They highlight the role of hormones (like oxytocin) and the accumulation of experiences \u2013 \u201cdurabonding\u201d \u2013 in forming a connection. The key passage discussing the difficulty is this: \u201cIt is also bad news that maternal bonding begins with hormones at birth.

The loss of those crucial early hormonal triggers and the missed opportunities for early bonding are what create the difficulty.\n\nConsidering the options:\n\n*   **A.** While a lack of early time *could* contribute, the core issue isn\u2019t simply missed time but the *timing* of the bonding process.\n*   **B.** Apprehension is a possible factor, but it doesn\u2019t explain the primary reason for the difficulty - the missed hormonal triggers.\n*   **C.** Confusion about the timing isn\u2019t the central point; it\u2019s the lack of established bonding.\n*   **D.** The author explicitly states that genetic relationship doesn't matter for the *formation* of love, so this is incorrect.\n\n**D**"

The author repeatedly emphasizes that bonding \u2013 whether through genetics or hormones \u2013 doesn't *determine* love; it\u2019s a byproduct of evolutionary pressures and biological processes that don't necessarily align with moral or ethical judgments.

If you're a mother who just adopted a child you'll naturally produce excess amounts of oxytocin.** - The article mentions oxytocin and its role in bonding, but it doesn\u2019t claim adoptive mothers *will* produce excess amounts. It simply points out it\u2019s a factor.\n*   **B. Oxytocin and Pitocin are functionally similar but, but one of the two would naturally be produced by a biological mother.** - The article touches on this, but the primary point is that Pitocin *could* mimic the bonding process, highlighting the artificiality of the mechanism.\n*   **C. If you're a biological parent you should supplement your naturally produced oxytocin with Pitocin.** - The article doesn\u2019t recommend this; it critiques the idea of artificially stimulating bonding.\n*   **D. If you adopted a child it would be bad for you to take Pitocin in their developmental stages.** - This accurately reflects the author's central argument: the focus on genetic relationships is misguided, and adoption doesn\u2019t diminish the possibility of genuine love and bonding.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D.\n\nD"
