This suggests a developing rapport.\n4. **Brotherhood:** The text explicitly states, \"prison can make brothers of all men.\"\n5. **Final Confirmation:** At the very end, Contarini refers to Broom as \"my friend.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB"

He also says he locked the door and then fainted.\n* **This indicates:** Broom seemingly materialized in Jasperson\u2019s office, and Jasperson is surprised and alarmed by his presence.

He has gone mad and is hallucinating:** The story describes a very specific sequence of events involving unfamiliar surroundings and a strange machine, rather than a general descent into madness.\n*   **B. He was kidnapped and tortured:** While he mentions being in prison, the text doesn't indicate torture as the cause of his memory loss.\n*   **C. He time traveled to the future, which caused amnesia:** The story explicitly mentions Broom\u2019s fellow prisoner, Contarini, talking about traveling through time and that \"movement through the time-river had a tendency to disorganize a man's memories.\" This is the most supported explanation within the text.\n*   **D. He had his memory wiped by the government:** The text provides no evidence of government involvement or memory manipulation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Broom's amnesia is a result of time travel.\n\nC"

Broom imagined the whole thing:** While there's a dreamlike quality, the details are too consistent and the ending confirms a real encounter with a police officer.\n*   **C. Broom was an evil man:** The story suggests he's a king who fought in the Crusades, and while there's fear, it's presented as a reaction to the unfamiliar, not an inherent evilness.\n*   **D. Broom was afraid:** Fear is a theme throughout the story, but it's not the *twist* itself.

By thinking about it:** Contarini suggests this is possible, stating that Broom could do it because he was \"braver\" and had \"the blood of kings\" which granted him protection. However, the text doesn't explicitly state that Broom *did* travel through time by thinking about it.\n*   **B. We never learn:** The text *does* offer explanations. While the precise mechanism is not detailed, it's implied he used a device.\n*   **C. Contarini sent him:** Contarini encourages Broom to try, but there's no indication he actively sent him or used any technology to do so.\n*   **D. It was an accident:** The story implies a device (the humming machine) was involved, and Broom touching a stud on it triggered the event. He didn\u2019t intend to travel in time, making it an unintended consequence.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is that it was an accident triggered by touching a device.\n\nD"
