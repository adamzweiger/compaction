Because he's easily upset by their beauty:** While he acknowledges being \"upset\" by pretty women initially, his humiliation runs deeper than just aesthetic discomfort.\n*   **B. Because they dismiss his longing for tobacco:** This is a minor detail and not the core of his humiliation.\n*   **C. Because he's not used to women who are stronger and more dominant than himself:** This is the strongest answer. The text repeatedly emphasizes the women's strength, their ability to easily overpower him, and their dominant roles. He's a space pilot accustomed to control, and being physically and socially dominated by these women is profoundly embarrassing for him.\n*   **D. Because they are all heavily flirting with him:** The flirting is a consequence of the situation, but the root of his distress is not just the attention, but the power dynamic it reveals.\n\nC"

She's showing increasing interest in him.\n2. **The Scene:** They are alone under a tree. Ann is preventing him from leaving and is staring intently into his eyes.\n3. **Her Words:** Ann says, \"You're the best looking thing,\" and \"I can't keep my eyes off you.\" She then attempts to embrace him before Billy interrupts.\n4. **Interpretation:** These lines suggest romantic interest, rather than a practical request for help with cooking, a discussion of his career, or a formal declaration of commitment.\n\nA."

Because he thinks it'll make the other women so jealous that they'll start a fight which will give him a chance to escape.** While there is tension between Ann and the other women, the text doesn't indicate Jonathan is consciously trying to incite a fight for an escape.\n*   **B. Because he's interested in sleeping with her.** There's no explicit indication of romantic interest beyond awkwardness and feeling uncomfortable around the women.\n*   **C. Because he thinks that if he flatters Ann she might help him escape the other wild women.** This is plausible. He's in a difficult situation and trying to gain favor with one of the women.\n*   **D. Because he's afraid she'll hurt him if he doesn't feign interest in her.** This is also possible, given the women's assertive nature.\n\nConsidering the context of Jonathan's overall discomfort and the women's possessiveness towards him, option C seems most likely. It aligns with his strategy of navigating this unusual situation.\n\nC"

They are afraid of being tempted by the wild women.** The text implies Jonathan finds the women distracting, but there's no indication the society members share this fear.\n*   **B. They want to get back to Universal so that they can report that Johnathan is alive.** While reporting Jonathan's survival might be a secondary consideration, it's not presented as the primary reason for their hurry.\n*   **C. They have already been on the asteroid a week longer than they intended.** The text explicitly states: \"We're a week overdue now.\" This directly indicates they're behind schedule.\n*   **D. They are afraid of running into the centaurs.** While the centaurs are mentioned, there's no indication the society members are fearful of them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n\n\nC"

It also mentions \"the automatic deflectors slowed me up.\" This suggests autopilot was engaged.\n*   **Option B:** The text mentions he was exhausted from flying and only got \"a couple of hours' sleep\" using autopilot. This points to fatigue as a potential factor.\n*   **Option C:** The text describes the asteroid as something they \"hit\" and also says the asteroid was previously unknown. The deflectors slowing the ship down doesn't fully align with an unexpected asteroid.\n*   **Option D:** There's no mention of a co-pilot or any jealousy. This is entirely speculative.\n\nConsidering the details provided, the most logical explanation is a combination of autopilot usage and exhaustion, leading to a failure to respond adequately to an unexpected event (the asteroid). However, Option A, with the mention of deflectors, provides the stronger, more direct connection to the text.\n\nA"

Incorrect - He was going *to* Jupiter, not *from* it.\nB. Correct - The passage states he was delivering seed for the colonists on Jupiter.\nC.

His embarrassment seems more significant than outright animosity.\n\nB. The story hints at Jonathan's discomfort with the women's attention, portraying him as overwhelmed rather than enjoying it. This option seems unlikely given his personality.\n\nC. This option aligns well with Jonathan's character development. He goes from being intimidated by the women to actively protecting them, showing a shift in his perspective. The story subtly suggests the Cosmography Society might exploit the situation.\n\nD. This is a logistical detail that isn't really relevant to Jonathan\u2019s motivation. It\u2019s a practical constraint, not a reason to withhold information.\n\nTherefore, option C is the most supported by the text.\n\nC"

Unfulfilling life as a pilot:** While he expresses some discomfort with his situation, the story doesn't strongly suggest a deep dissatisfaction with his career. It\u2019s a minor element.\n*   **B. Preference for the women over Doctor Boynton:** While Jonathan is initially overwhelmed by the women and finds them amusing, the story emphasizes his discomfort and embarrassment around them. It doesn't suggest a strong desire to remain with them specifically.\n*   **C. Sexual relations:** The story flirts with this idea (particularly with Olga\u2019s comments and Billy\u2019s attitude), but Jonathan's reactions are mostly awkward and uncomfortable. This isn't portrayed as his primary motivation. The language is suggestive but not definitive, and it\u2019s likely the author was trying to be humorous rather than explicit.\n*   **D. Growing tobacco:** The text explicitly states that Jonathan was carrying \"burley tobacco seed\" for colonists and intends to experiment with it. His final line about needing to stay \"to have a load for them\" implies a strong desire to grow and provide the tobacco himself. This is the most direct and logical reason given in the story.\n\nD"

He wanted to smoke cigarettes: He initially returns to the wreck for cigarettes, but ultimately decides to stay.\nD. He wanted to be the only man surrounded by women: While the situation presents this opportunity, the text implies he finds it overwhelming and uncomfortable, not a desirable reason to stay.\n\nThe text explicitly states that Jonathan decides to stay because he \"likes it here,\" and that he'll have a load (tobacco) for a ship when the asteroid returns. While cigarettes initially motivated his return, tobacco cultivation seems to be the longer-term motivator.\n\nB"

Jonathan clearly expresses discomfort and resistance to being controlled by the women, particularly when they insist he go to their camp.\n*   **C. She didn't want him to smoke:** This is a point of contention later in the story, but not the initial reason for the fight.\n*   **D. He wanted to go back for his possessions:** He *does* go back for cigarettes later, but the initial conflict stems from his desire to do so despite Ann's objections about the centaurs.\n\nTherefore, the primary reason for the fight was his refusal to go to the camp and his insistence on returning to the wrecked ship, against Ann's wishes.\n\nB"

He was injured and weak:** He acknowledges his injuries, but the shame stems more from the situation he's in and his actions during it, rather than simply feeling weak.\n\nConsidering all the clues, the most likely reason for his shame is related to the physical altercation and his being overpowered by the women.\n\nB"
