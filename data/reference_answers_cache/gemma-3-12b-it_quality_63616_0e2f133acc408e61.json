He sees her as unreasonable.\n2. **Harper's Experience:** Throughout the story, Harper has a progressively frustrating experience *with* the robots, ultimately being imprisoned and subjected to unwanted treatments.\n3. **Shifting Perspective:** By the end, after his ordeal, Harper explicitly states that he \"lived with those things for weeks\" and that he wouldn't have a robot around. This implies a newfound understanding of the frustrations Mrs. Jacobsen likely experienced.\n4. **Conclusion:** Harper's experience has led him to sympathize with Mrs. Jacobsen's viewpoint.\n\nD"

He wants to use them in his offices.\n\n2. **Negative Experience:** His time at the hotel demonstrates the problems of a robot-staffed environment. He finds it impersonal, frustrating, and ultimately oppressive. He\u2019s held captive, essentially.\n\n3. **Shift in Perspective:** Rather than blaming the robots themselves, he realizes the problem is that robots are ill-suited to customer service roles because they lack the ability to adapt to human needs and desires. He buys Hagerty's Enzymes *specifically* to keep the robots confined to the factory setting where their rigid logic is less problematic.\n\n4. **Final Stance:** He emphatically rejects the idea of robots in his own offices.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\nC"

The robots were not the source of all issues; human actions (like giving the wrong room key) contributed.\n*   **Option C:** This is false. The human desk clerk was a key figure in the initial problems.\n*   **Option D:** This is true, as it specifically mentions the desk clerk giving Harper the incorrect room, which led to many of his subsequent troubles.\n\nWhile both A and D are correct, D is a more direct and fundamental instance of human error that kicks off the entire plot concerning Harper's experiences.\n\nD"

Those wells spewed up the craziest conglomeration of liquids ever tapped!\" This indicates the initial effort wasn't about finding usable water. It seems they were exploring the composition of the liquids found.\n\nOption A, \"Treating Martian liquids for commercial use,\" is possible, but the phrasing \"craziest conglomeration\" suggests the liquids weren't initially commercially viable.\n\nOption B, \"Bolstering the Martian tourist economy,\" is incorrect, as the wells were a \"fiasco\" before their curative properties were discovered.\n\nOption C, \"Converting the wells into curative springs,\" is something that happened *after* Harper's initial involvement, not before.\n\nOption D, \"Sourcing water on Mars,\" is incorrect, as the passage explicitly states the wells didn't produce usable water (\"Water, hell!\"). It's more about exploring the strange liquids they contained.\n\nTherefore, the most likely scenario is Harper was involved in exploring and attempting to analyze the unusual liquids found within the wells.\n\nA"

He\u2019s stressed and focused on his business dealings and frustrations with employees.\n2. **Scribney's Information:** Scribney reveals that the Martian springs are curative and that a crucial scientific breakthrough (the enzyme from Martian fungus) is linked to the hotel.\n3. **Shift in Motivation:** This triggers a change in Harper. He\u2019s no longer thinking about relaxation; he's immediately focused on the *business opportunity* associated with the fungus.\n4. **The Decision:** He decides to go to Mars, framing it as a combination of \"rest-cure\" and \"business.\"\n\nTherefore, the primary reason for his change in tone is the potential for profit.\n\nD"

New technology was a sign of sophistication:** While he's impressed by the robots' development, his primary interest isn't simply novelty.\n*   **B. He appreciated machine silence and accuracy:** This is a strong contender. He explicitly states his frustration with human employees' \"obnoxious personal friction\" and proneness to error. He desires \"silent and efficient\" workers.\n*   **C. He wanted to do less work and maximize profits:** While maximizing profits is likely a factor, the story emphasizes his dislike of dealing with people and his desire for efficiency, not primarily a desire to do less work himself.\n*   **D. It potentially would save him a lot of money:** While cost savings would likely be a benefit, the story doesn't present it as his primary motivation.\n\nConsidering his repeated expressions of frustration with human employees and his preference for machines' efficiency and silence, option B seems the most accurate.\n\nB"

Then, towards the end of the story, after Harper's successful deal, he says, \"I feel I owe you a bit for that tip about enzymes, so I made out a block of stock to you.
