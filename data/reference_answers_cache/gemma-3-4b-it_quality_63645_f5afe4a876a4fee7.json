He stored his people\u2019s treasures \u2013 riches from various cities \u2013 within a globe of transparent metal filled with a special mist. This mist destroyed dust and germs, and Irgi discovered it when it was \u201ctoo late to save his kind.\u201d Furthermore, he harnessed a \u201cblue hum and throb\u201d from cones and a block of radiant white matter to create immortality. The text emphasizes that this \u201cblue light\u201d made him immortal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the combination of the mist and the blue light.\n\nA"

The mist was not a preventative measure, but a means of preserving what remained of their treasures after their destruction. The text also explicitly connects their downfall to a disease \u2013 \"the growth disease\" \u2013 which is why he was trying to find radium.\n\nConsidering these clues, option D, \"They died from cancer,\" is the most plausible explanation, as the text explicitly links their demise to this disease and Irgi\u2019s efforts to find a cure.\n\nD"

He seems to derive pleasure from his work and maintaining his city.\n3.  **Immortality connection:** The text explicitly states that the blue light \u201cmade him so\u201d \u2013 immortal. This strongly suggests the light is somehow integral to his immortality.\n4.  **Eliminate unlikely options:**\n    *   **A:** The text doesn't mention a lack of water or ultraviolet cleansing.\n    *   **C:** While the text does mention the cones and block relate to immortality, it doesn't state that he is administering a cancer treatment.\n    *   **D:** While a religious ritual is possible, the text doesn't present any evidence of a specific ritual.\n\nConsidering these points, option B \u2013 the light just feels good, kind of like warming your hands over a campfire. Since there is no one to stop him, he just basks in the light for pleasure \u2013 best fits the description of his behavior.\n\nB"

There\u2019s no mention of a crash landing or of Irgi discovering the ship. The text emphasizes the ship\u2019s deliberate descent towards Urg, driven by a specific purpose \u2013 to locate the radium. The description of the \u201cgreen beam\u201d and the ship settling on the planet suggests a controlled approach, not a random arrival. Option C is also incorrect as it suggests prior contact and notification.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the ship\u2019s entry is through a carefully orchestrated descent facilitated by the planet\u2019s unique properties \u2013 the cones and the block.\n\nD"

While he initially wants to \u2018cleanse\u2019 them and make them amenable to his will, the images suggest a level of complexity and resilience that is perhaps surprising.

He\u2019s operating under the assumption of benevolence and a shared desire for survival.

He doesn\u2019t consider their potential resistance or hostility.\n\nOption A is plausible, as it touches on the possibility of a negative reaction to his actions. However, it focuses too much on individual preference rather than the broader issue of communication and misunderstanding.\n\nOption B highlights a key element: the aliens\u2019 inability to communicate and their likely interpretation of the restraints and pain as aggression. This is a much more central failing.\n\nOption C is relevant to the overall situation \u2013 the presence of potentially malevolent individuals \u2013 but doesn't directly address the core of his misjudgment about their willingness to cooperate.\n\nOption D is a logistical consideration, not a fundamental flaw in his approach.
