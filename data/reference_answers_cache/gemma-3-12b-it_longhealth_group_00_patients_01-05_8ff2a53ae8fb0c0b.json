Levothyroxine sodium 50 \u00b5g also initially.\n\n*   **Medications at Discharge (from the final report):** Lisinopril 10mg, Bisoprolol 2.5mg, Acetaminophen, Allopurinol 100mg, Atorvastatin 40mg, Ezetimibe 10mg, Levetiracetam 1000mg once daily, Lacosamide 100mg, and Levothyroxine sodium 50 \u00b5g. The Sertraline was not present in the discharge list.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n*   **A:** Levetiracetam was reduced from 1000mg twice daily to 1000mg once daily. This is incorrect.\n*   **B:** Lisinopril remained at 10mg once daily. Lacosamide was *added*, not used as a replacement, so this is incorrect.\n*   **C:** Sertraline was *discontinued*, not reduced, so this is incorrect.\n*   **D:** Januvia was still present and didn't change (50mg twice daily), and Levothyroxine sodium has been consistently present, so this statement is incorrect.\n*   **E:** Acetaminophen was not a combination of Ezetimibe and Bisoprolol. Acetaminophen was added at discharge, while Ezetimibe and Bisoprolol dosage remained the same, so this is incorrect.\n\n\n\nAfter thorough review, none of the statements are perfectly accurate, however, A comes closest to being correct, as Levetiracetem was changed.\n\nA"
