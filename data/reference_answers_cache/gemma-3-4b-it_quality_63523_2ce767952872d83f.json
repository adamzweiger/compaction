Carlson confronts Grimm about Charlotte sleeping beside him. Grimm\u2019s response is dismissive and he says \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make trouble\u201d. This suggests he\u2019s bothered by the intimacy between Charlotte and Carlson, viewing it as a distraction from their mission.\n\nNow let\u2019s consider the options:\n\n*   **A.** Because he is Charlotte's friend and he doesn't think that Carlson is good enough for her. \u2013 This is unlikely; Grimm\u2019s annoyance isn\u2019t about Charlotte\u2019s judgment of Carlson.\n*   **B.** Because he is Charlotte's father and does not approve of the relationship. \u2013 The passage doesn\u2019t indicate a father-daughter relationship between them.\n*   **C.** Because he is the leader of the expedition and doesn\u2019t want his crew to get distracted with romance. \u2013 This aligns with the fact he wants to avoid \u201cmaking trouble\u201d and focus on the mission.\n*   **D.** Because he is in love with Charlotte and is jealous of the affection between her and Carlson. \u2013 While possible, the immediate reaction is more about distraction and avoiding trouble than overt jealousy.\n\nThe most logical and directly supported explanation is that Grimm is annoyed because he doesn\u2019t want the crew to be distracted by romantic relationships during a dangerous mission.\n\n**C**"

In their difficulty understanding signals that women send them:** The story explicitly states that the white men *received* signals and words through thought, demonstrating an ability to understand a form of telepathy. This contrasts with Ro\u2019s own experience and suggests a difference in their communication methods, not a shared difficulty.\n\n*   **B. In their eagerness to enter into combat situations:** Ro actively plans and orchestrates a battle against the Oan, while the white men are initially hesitant and then participate in a planned assault. Ro takes the lead in the aggression.\n\n*   **C. In their need to establish themselves as the more dominant male through physical prowess:** Ro repeatedly asserts his dominance and control over the situation, using his strength and strategic thinking to overcome the Oan. The white men seem less concerned with establishing dominance through physical strength.\n\n*   **D. In their attachment to and rivalry over women:** The story highlights a significant tension between Ro and Na, and the white men also display a subtle rivalry for her attention. The white man, Grimm, seems especially frustrated by Ro\u2019s claim of choosing Na as his mate.\n\nConsidering the narrative, the most accurate description of Ro's relationship with the white men is their shared attachment to and rivalry over women.\n\nD"

However, when he interacts with the humans and observes their behavior (particularly Carlson\u2019s dismissive attitude and the concept of \u201cHollywood\u201d marriage), he begins to question the value of their complicated systems.

The key element is the ease of communication and the ability to transmit complex ideas without the potential for misinterpretation.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n*   **A. Telepathy takes less concentration than speaking aloud.** While this might be true, it doesn't explain the *driving force* behind developing the ability. It's a consequence, not a motivation.\n*   **B. Telepathy is ideal for keeping sensitive information secret, since it cannot be accidentally overheard.** The story focuses on communication, not secrecy. The need for secrecy isn't a primary theme.\n*   **C. Telepathy enables communication across language barriers.** This aligns perfectly with the passage's description of overcoming a language barrier through direct thought transmission.\n*   **D. Telepathy eliminates the misunderstanding that comes with words.** This directly addresses the core issue presented in the story - the problem of misunderstanding caused by spoken language and different interpretations.\n\nTherefore, the strongest motivator is the elimination of misunderstanding.\n\nD"
