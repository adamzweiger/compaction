Donald Trump being elected, B. The Enlightenment, C. World War II, D. The Age of Anger.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points from the article. The author discusses how the political landscape has shifted, emphasizing the role of emotions in politics. They mention that since the Enlightenment, there's been a focus on rationality and materialism, which has made it difficult to understand the surge in emotional politics, like with Brexit and Trump.\n\nThe article references Pankaj Mishra's book \"The Age of Anger,\" which the author uses to discuss how the current political climate is characterized by a return to emotional responses. The author argues that the Enlightenment's emphasis on rationality has left a gap in understanding emotions, leading to the rise of populist movements that exploit emotional appeals.\n\nThe question is about the turning point for the modern reason-based political climate. The author seems to be critical of the Enlightenment's focus on reason and how that has led to a current situation where emotions are being repressed. However, the turning point mentioned in the text is the current surge in emotional politics, which the author links to the \"Age of Anger\" as discussed by Mishra. \n\nWait, the article says that the Enlightenment's materialist views are part of the problem. The current political climate's issues are due to the Enlightenment's influence. But the turning point for the modern reason-based climate would be when that reason-based approach started to be challenged. However, the answer options don't include the Enlightenment as the turning point. The article mentions that the Enlightenment's ideas are part of the problem, but the turning point for the current situation is the rise of emotions, which is tied to the \"Age of Anger\" as per Mishra. \n\nAlternatively, the author might be suggesting that the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason is the root of the current problem. But the question is about the turning point for the modern reason-based political climate. The article says that the Enlightenment's focus on reason has made it hard to understand the current emotional politics. So maybe the turning point is the Enlightenment itself. But the options are A to D. The answer is B. The Enlightenment? Or D. The Age of Anger?\n\nWait, the author says that the current political climate's issues are because of the Enlightenment's materialist views. The \"Age of Anger\" is a book by Mishra that the author references. The author is saying that the current political climate is a reaction to the Enlightenment's rationalism, leading to the \"Age of Anger.\" So the turning point for the modern reason-based political climate would be the Enlightenment, which is B. But the question is about the turning point for the modern reason-based climate. The author is pointing out that the Enlightenment's approach is the root of the problem, so the turning point is the Enlightenment. But the answer options are A to D. The answer is B. The Enlightenment. However, the article says that the current situation is a reaction to the Enlightenment's ideas. So the turning point for the reason-based political climate is the Enlightenment. Therefore, the answer is B.\n</think>\n\nB"

The options are A, B, C, or D.\n\nLooking back at the article, the first part mentions that Sophie Walker gave a speech at the conference, talking about her struggles as a single parent with an autistic daughter. The article then talks about the conference being \"awash with talk about women 'doing politics differently'\". It also mentions that the conference was part of leading up to the Women's March on Washington after Trump's inauguration. \n\nThe article discusses the party's goals, like closing the gender pay gap, subsidizing childcare, etc., which are policy issues. It also talks about practice, like how women are approaching politics differently, emphasizing emotions and empathy. The conference was about promoting these policies and practices. \n\nOption A says \"Enacting new equality based political policies and practices\". The article does mention policy areas they're promoting, and the practice of doing politics differently. So A seems correct. \n\nOption B is about networking for women entering politics. The article does mention women from across the political spectrum, but the focus was more on policies and practices rather than networking. \n\nOption C is about voting on Brexit, but the article mentions the Women's March after Trump's election, not Brexit. \n\nOption D is protesting Trump's election. The march is after his inauguration, but the conference itself wasn't about protesting his election. \n\nSo the answer should be A.\n</think>\n\nA"

The options are A, B, C, or D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the main points of the article. The author talks about how politics has been dominated by rational, materialist views since the Enlightenment, which downplays emotions. This has led to a situation where emotions are stigmatized, especially in men, and populist leaders like Trump and Brexiters use emotions to gain support by channeling people's feelings. The author then suggests that women's activism brings a different sensibility that acknowledges emotions as necessary and messy. \n\nThe author mentions that women's activism can offer a politics that starts with emotions, not repressing them. They also talk about how women in politics can create a different environment where emotions are accepted, like when Sophie Walker's speech was received positively. The author also notes that having more women in political roles can change the dynamics, leading to more collaborative and empathetic approaches. \n\nLooking at the options, A is about including more women. The article does discuss how women's presence in politics changes the way things are done, leading to more emotional and empathetic approaches. The author mentions that women in parliament collaborate more and that having 40% women changes the language of business. So A seems plausible. \n\nOption C suggests forced integration of emotion, but the author doesn't mention forcing it. Instead, they talk about acknowledging emotions naturally. Option D is about re-educating the next generation, which isn't exactly what the author says. The author focuses more on the current political landscape and the role of women in changing it. Option B is about strongmen leaders, which the author actually criticizes. \n\nSo the answer is likely A. The author argues that including more women in politics can bring a different approach that values emotions, which is the solution to the lack of emotion in politics.\n</think>\n\nA"

The options are A to D.\n\nLooking back at the article, the author mentions that both campaigns were \"deeply reactionary\" and offered a return to past fantasies. They also talk about how the campaigns channeled emotions, allowing people to associate with winning and displacing pain. The author points out that the campaigns tapped into people's emotions, which were suppressed, and provided a way to express those feelings by blaming others. \n\nOption A says they reminisced about past racist and sexist attitudes. The article does mention nostalgia for a time when the nation had a common destiny with white men, which aligns with A. But the author also talks about the emotional aspect, which is more about the feelings people had, not just racism and sexism.\n\nOption B is about appealing to hard-working, no-whining people. The article says that men are supposed to contain emotions, and the campaigns allowed people to feel they were winners, which fits with B. But the author also mentions that the campaigns were reactionary, which might relate to A.\n\nOption D says it's due to a lack of outlet for suppressed emotions. The article does mention that people's emotions were metastasizing and that the campaigns provided a way to channel them. The author says that the campaigns allowed people to blame others, which is about expressing emotions. So D might be correct.\n\nBut the question is about why the author thinks they were successful. The article says that the campaigns found a way to channel emotions, allowing electorates to associate with winning and displacing pain. The author also says that the campaigns were reactionary, offering a return to past fantasies. The answer might be D because the author talks about the emotional outlet. However, the article also mentions that the campaigns were reactionary, which is A.

The author also says that the campaigns were deeply reactionary, offering a return to past fantasies. But the question is why the author thinks they were successful. The answer might be D because the author says that the campaigns allowed people to express their emotions, which were otherwise suppressed. The author also mentions that the populist right channeled feelings, often displacing them onto someone else. So D is about lack of outlet for suppressed emotions. The answer is D.\n</think>\n\nD"

The options are A, B, C, or D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points from the article. The author discusses how liberal arguments often seem disconnected from people's emotional experiences. The article mentions that liberals talk in a \"parallel universe\" that doesn't resonate with the emotions people are feeling. The author points out that the populist right channels emotions to gain support, while liberals struggle to address the emotional aspects of people's lives. \n\nThe problem with liberal policy, according to the author, is that they focus on rational arguments and facts, which don't connect with the emotional needs of the population, especially men who feel marginalized. The author also mentions that liberals' solutions often don't address the emotional roots of people's dissatisfaction, leading to a backlash. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA. Liberals aren't good at appealing to emotionally blocked majority male population. This seems to align with the article's point about emotions being stigmatized and the need for a different approach. \n\nB. Too pushy with marginalized groups. The article doesn't mention this; it's more about not addressing emotions rather than being pushy. \n\nC. Not enough policy to fight capitalism's inequalities. The article does talk about capitalism's failures, but the main issue the author points out is the emotional disconnect, not the quantity of policies. \n\nD. Not including enough women. The article does mention women's activism and their role, but the main issue is about emotional appeal, not gender inclusion. \n\nSo the correct answer should be A. The author argues that liberals fail to connect with the emotional needs of people, especially men, which is a major issue.\n</think>\n\nA"

The options are A to D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relevant part of the article. The author discusses how populist movements like Brexit and Trump's campaign have channeled emotions. The key points mentioned are that these movements allow electorates to associate themselves with winning by blaming others, displacing their own emotions onto someone else. The author also mentions that populist right has found an emotive way to engage electorates by channelling their feelings, often displacing them onto someone else. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA. Including more women \u2013 the article does talk about women's activism, but the question is about populists. The author says women's movement is different, so A might not be right.\n\nB. Blaming others for negative emotions \u2013 the text says \"displacing them onto someone else in the process.\" This matches B.\n\nC. Convincing people to embrace their emotional relationship \u2013 the author says that liberals are talking in a parallel universe, but populists channel emotions. However, the author also says that populists channel feelings, but the key is displacement, not embracing. \n\nD. Ignoring emotion \u2013 no, the author says they use emotion.\n\nSo the correct answer is B. The author argues that populists succeed by making people blame others for their emotions, which is displacement. The text says \"the only way to self-esteem is to be a winner. And someone else must therefore become the loser.\" So B is correct.\n</think>\n\nB"

The options are A, B, C, or D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points from the article. The author discusses how populist movements like Trump and Brexit channeled emotions, and how traditional politics often ignores emotions. The author also mentions that liberals and social democrats are seen as talking in a parallel universe, not addressing the emotional needs of people. \n\nLooking at the options, option B says it's about focus on identity politics and eliminating problematic language. The article does mention that some critics argue that feminists, along with other groups, have been too focused on policing language and behavior, leading to a backlash. The author also says that the problem is assuming white men's lives are neutral, which is male identity politics. \n\nOption C talks about humiliating men for negative emotions. The article does mention that men's emotions are stigmatized, and that when they can't express vulnerability, they act out. However, the author's main point about backlash against feminism is more about the focus on identity politics and language rather than directly humiliating men. \n\nOption A suggests failure to appeal to emotions. The author argues that liberals don't address emotions, but the backlash against feminism is more about the movement's approach to language and identity. \n\nOption D is about lack of intersectionality. The article does mention that there's a glass-ceiling feminism that doesn't consider race, class, etc., but the main reason for backlash is more about the focus on identity politics and language. \n\nSo the correct answer is B. The author says that the backlash is due to the policing of language and behavior, which some call courtesy, leading to a backlash.

They mention that the Enlightenment focused on rationality, but that's not enough. The author argues that emotions are necessary and that politics needs to acknowledge them. There's a part where they reference Plato's charioteer and the wild horse, which is about balancing reason and passion. Also, the author praises Sophie Walker's speech where she showed vulnerability, which is emotional. \n\nThe author also says that a female sensibility in politics isn't against reason but emphasizes honesty about feelings. They mention that women in politics can create a different approach where emotions are acknowledged without being seen as weakness. So, the author seems to think that both logic and emotion are important, but the key is their cooperation. The answer might be A. But wait, the question is about the most important quality.

Allows people, especially men, to avoid confronting anxieties \u2013 This seems closer. The author says that men can't express vulnerability, so they disguise it as strength. The article mentions that men's anxiety is denied, leading to a privatisation of misery. So this might be the answer.\n\nC. Fosters low confidence and negative worldview \u2013 The article does mention anxiety and feeling of historical betrayal, but the main point is about repression and not addressing emotions, not directly about low confidence.\n\nD. Inferior to reason \u2013 The author argues that emotion is necessary and that current political thinking is too rationalist, so this might not be correct. The author is saying that emotion is important and that the current system undervalues it.\n\nSo the best answer is B.

      "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which word least describes Sophie Walker. The options are passionate, intelligent, manipulative, or privileged.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the context from the article. Sophie Walker is the leader of the Women's Equality Party. In her speech, she talked about her struggles as a single parent with an autistic daughter, mentioning that no one cared about her daughter's needs. She cried during her speech, which was a significant moment. The article also mentions that she's a white, university-educated journalist. \n\nThe article says that her tears were powerful and that her personal story highlighted her daughter's diagnosis, which punctured her own privilege. So she's described as privileged because of her background. The text says she's a \"white, university-educated journalist\" which points to her being privileged. \n\nNow, the options. The question is which word least describes her. The article doesn't mention her being manipulative. In fact, her speech was about her genuine struggles, and she was portrayed as sincere. The article says that her tears were persuasive and that her story was moving. So \"manipulative\" doesn't fit. \n\nPassionate: She was emotional and passionate in her speech, so that's a fit.

The author mentions that initially, the reader might think her crying was a weakness, but then realizes it was a powerful moment that highlighted her message about her daughter's struggles and the broader issues of women's activism.\n\nThe main idea of the passage seems to be about how women's activism is different in politics, emphasizing emotions and empathy. The speech is used as an example to illustrate how emotional expression can be a strength in political advocacy, countering the traditional view that emotions are weak.\n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA. Danger of emotions in politics \u2013 but the article seems to argue that emotions are necessary, not dangerous. So A is probably not right.\n\nB. Make the reader sympathetic towards female politicians \u2013 maybe, but the main point isn't just sympathy, but about the role of emotions in politics.\n\nC. Show the author's feelings \u2013 the author does express their initial reaction, but the purpose of the speech example is more about supporting the main argument, not just the author's personal feelings.\n\nD. Example to support the main idea \u2013 the main idea is that women's activism brings a different approach, using emotions. The speech is an example of that, showing how emotional expression can be powerful and persuasive. So D seems correct.\n</think>\n\nD"

      "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The passage is about how emotions are playing a bigger role in politics, especially with the rise of movements like the Women's Equality Party and the Trump/Brexit examples. The author argues that traditional political thinking has been too rational and materialistic, ignoring emotions. The key point is that emotions are now more central because people are feeling the impact of inequality and other issues, and leaders like Trump and Brexiters are using that emotion to gain support.\n\nThe question is asking for the best summary of the emotions described. The options are A, B, C, D. Let's break them down. \n\nOption A says females are using more emotions, but males stay rational. The passage does mention women's activism and their use of emotions, but it also talks about how men are suppressing emotions. However, the main point isn't just about females vs. males but about the broader role of emotions in politics.\n\nOption B states that emotions are used more in politics than before. The passage does talk about a shift where emotion is back in fashion, and the Trump and Brexit movements are examples of this. The author argues that emotions are now a significant part of political engagement, so this seems possible.\n\nOption C says emotions are too stereotyped to be valid. The passage actually argues the opposite, that emotions are necessary and should be acknowledged, not dismissed. So C is probably wrong.\n\nOption D claims emotions are too powerful and shouldn't be involved. The author is against the idea that emotions are to be suppressed, so D is not correct.\n\nSo between A and B. The passage is more about the increased use of emotions in politics, not just women using them.

The options are A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relevant parts of the article. The author discusses the role of emotion in politics, mentioning that Brexit and Trump were fueled by emotional appeals rather than rational arguments. The author criticizes the populist right for channeling emotions to gain support, which leads to reactionary outcomes. The article also points out that the Brexit campaign used nostalgia and emotional narratives, which the author sees as a reaction to the failures of capitalism and the inability of traditional politics to address people's emotional needs.\n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA. It would have gone differently if people were more logical. The author seems to think that the emotional aspects were crucial, so maybe this is a possible answer. The author mentions that the populist right channeled emotions, which might suggest that logic wasn't sufficient.\n\nB. Backed by research and an iconic move. The article doesn't mention research; instead, it talks about emotional appeal. So B might not be right.\n\nC. A turning point for Britain. The article does mention Brexit as part of a broader trend, but the author's tone is more critical of the emotional aspects rather than seeing it as a positive turning point. The author seems to view it as a reaction to deeper issues.\n\nD. Emotional persuasion was used appropriately. The author is critical of the use of emotion, saying it's a self-defeating way. The author argues that the populist right exploited emotions, which isn't seen as appropriate. So D is likely incorrect.\n\nThe author's main point is that the Brexit and Trump movements used emotional appeals, which the author sees as a problem. The author suggests that the emotional responses were a reaction to the failures of traditional politics, which didn't address people's emotional needs. Therefore, the author might think that Brexit was more about emotional manipulation rather than logical decision-making.

The author argues against this, saying that emotions are necessary and that the current political system doesn't acknowledge them. So C is the opposite of what the author says.\n\nD. Emotions are complicated but can be advantageous when expressed properly. The author does say that emotions are important and that expressing them (like in Sophie's speech) can be persuasive.

The options are Jane Austen, Simon Jenkins, Donald Trump, and Nicky Morgan.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the article's content. The article discusses how women's activism, particularly through emotional expression, can influence politics. It mentions Sophie Walker's speech where she cried about her daughter's challenges, which moved the audience and highlighted the importance of emotional expression in politics. The article also contrasts this with Trump's use of emotion, which is more about manipulation and populism, not positive change. \n\nJane Austen is mentioned in the context of her novels showing the balance between sense and sensibility, which is about emotional intelligence. However, she's a literary figure, not a political figure. The article doesn't say she's using emotion for political change. \n\nSimon Jenkins is mentioned as someone who argues that policing language and behavior has contributed to populism. He's part of the criticism towards feminist and other activism groups, so he's not an example of using emotion positively. \n\nDonald Trump is discussed as someone who uses emotion in a way that's more about displacement of pain and populism, which is not positive. The article says his approach is exploitative. \n\nNicky Morgan is a politician mentioned as a former Conservative Education Secretary who spoke at the Women's Equality Party conference. The article talks about how women in politics, like Morgan, can collaborate across parties and use a different approach. However, the question is about using emotion for positive change. The article emphasizes that women's activism, including emotional expression, can lead to positive political changes. \n\nBut the question is about who has best used emotion. The article's main point is that women's activism, through emotional expression, can make a difference. Sophie Walker's example is given as a positive use of emotion. However, the options don't include her. The closest is Nicky Morgan, but she's more of a political figure who collaborates. \n\nAlternatively, the article says that Jane Austen's work shows the reconciliation of sense and sensibility, which is about emotional intelligence.
