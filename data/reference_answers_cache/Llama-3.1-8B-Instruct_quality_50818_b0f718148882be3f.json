To be able to practice poor hygiene - This is indeed one of the reasons Manet wanted to be alone, as mentioned in the passage: \"he would be able to get as fat and as dirty as he liked\".\n\nB. To see how long it would take to go mad - This is also one of the reasons Manet wanted to be alone, as stated in the passage: \"he would be able to measure the qualities of loneliness to the point of madness\".\n\nC. To compare peace and war - This is indeed another reason Manet wanted to be alone, as mentioned in the passage: \"he would be able to measure the qualities of peace and decide whether it was really better than war\".\n\nD. To feel bored - This option does not match the context of the passage.

This implies that Manet didn't have to do much work at the station. However, it also mentions that Manet was the human Overseer at the station. An Overseer is typically someone who oversees or supervises something, so it's likely that Manet was in charge of the station.\n\nThe text also mentions that Manet had a salary of two hundred thousand dollars a year, which suggests that he was a human presence at the station for some reason, likely to oversee its operation.\n\nTherefore, Manet's job was likely to oversee or control the atmosphere seeder station.\n\nB"

Manet had been lonely and isolated on Mars for a long time, and he was desperate for companionship.\n2. He had ordered the LIFO kit, which was supposed to provide him with friends, but it didn't quite live up to his expectations.\n3. Manet became frustrated with the artificial personalities of Ronald and Veronica, which were too one-dimensional and didn't challenge him intellectually.\n4. He realized that he needed someone to interact with who could provide a sense of competition and challenge, which is why he created Victor, the final model, as his adversary.\n\nGiven this analysis, Manet locked Ronald and Veronica in the small room because they would not do as he said, which is option C."

The Voice of the B.B.C. mentions that the original estimate for atmosphere seeding was 18.2 years, but it has been revised.\n2. The Voice also mentions that three years ago, the official estimate was changed to 31 years.\n3. Manet thinks about the 18-year estimate mentioned by the Voice and compares it to the current time, realizing he has been at his post for a significant portion of the estimated time.\n\nGiven this information, it is likely that Manet has been at his post on Mars for at least 18 years, but possibly more since the estimate was revised three years ago. Since the text does not provide a specific time frame, we can estimate that Manet has been on Mars for around 18 years.\n\nHowever, since the revised estimate was made three years ago, Manet has been on Mars for at least 18 - 3 = 15 years. However, considering the 3-year gap in the estimates, Manet has been on Mars for at least 15 + 3 = 18 years, but since the Voice says that the original estimate was \"substantially correct\", Manet has been on Mars for 18 years.\n\nThe closest option to 18 years is D. 17 years, so I will guess that.\n\nD"
