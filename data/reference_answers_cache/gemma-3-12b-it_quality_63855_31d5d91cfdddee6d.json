While he's a capable commander, it's not the primary factor.\n\nC. Being close by is not mentioned as a factor in their selection.\n\nD. The text states that the \"Cleopatra's a surge circuit monitor, and it's a safe bet this operation takes plenty of power.\" This directly links her selection to her ability to handle the power requirements of \"Project Warp.\"\n\nTherefore, the main reason is her power capabilities.\n\nD"

To prepare for battle against the Eridans:** While the Cleopatra eventually engages in battle, the welding happens *before* this. The text describes it as part of an earlier process.\n*   **B. To enable travel to hyperspace:** The text states that Project Warp aims to \"make a hyper-ship out of her\" and that \"weird screen-like appendages\" were welded on. This aligns directly with the text's explanation of Project Warp and the ship's purpose.\n*   **C. Maintenance during a twenty-day leave:** The text doesn't mention a leave, and the modifications are far more extensive than routine maintenance.\n*   **D. To make it through the asteroid belt:** The text mentions the ship successfully navigating the asteroid belt earlier in the story, so the appendages weren't for this purpose.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nB"

He did not like him:** The passage mentions \"Space Admiral Gorman had no great affection for either the Cleopatra or her crew,\" implying a lack of fondness.\n*   **C. He liked him for pulling his flagship out of a tight spot:** The text *does* state that Strike had previously \"pulled Admiral Gorman's flagship Atropos out of a tight spot.\" This suggests a prior positive relationship based on that event.\n*   **D. He had him mixed up with some other guy named Strykalski:** This is explicitly mentioned as a possibility by Cob Whitley, but it is dismissed.\n\nTherefore, the text indicates that Gorman had a positive, albeit potentially strained, relationship with Strike due to Strike's past actions.\n\nC"

The radiation net and heat rays are Eridan weapons, and rifle fire and torpedoes are Cleopatra's.\n*   C: Chlorine gas isn\u2019t a weapon and heat rays is used to describe the Eridan weapons in general.\n*   D: Incorrectly reverses the weaponry.\n\nTherefore, the best description is B.\n\nB"

They were breathing chlorine gas:** The text mentions they \"breathe chlorine,\" but doesn't connect this to a lack of concern for death.\n*   **B. They had no mind inside their bodies:** The text explicitly states the Eridans have a \"group-mind\" that exists separately from individual bodies. This is a key piece of information. Because their individual existence is less important than the group-mind, individual deaths are less impactful.\n*   **C. They had 150 spaceships:** Having a large fleet doesn't explain a lack of concern for individual lives.\n*   **D. They were warlike:** Being warlike implies a desire to conquer, not necessarily a disregard for personal survival.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B because their individual existence wasn\u2019t prioritized due to their group-mind structure.\n\nB"

Because Gorman appointed them to the experiment:** While Gorman initially assigned them to Tethys, the decision to use hyperspace was a response to the Eridan attack.\n*   **C. Because they needed time to fix the drive:** The drive was damaged *during* the encounter, so this isn't the reason they initially entered hyperspace. The ship entered hyperspace to escape the Eridan attack.\n*   **D. Because Ivy requested the ship for the experiment:** Ivy initiated the experiment, but she didn\u2019t order the ship into hyperspace. Strike did, as a desperate measure to escape the Eridan attack.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that they used hyperspace to escape the Eridan attack, not as part of the initial experiment.\n\nB"

They were already in route to Eridanus:** While they *were* initially heading towards Eridanus, that was before entering the alien cosmos. The question asks about navigation *within* the alien cosmos.\n*   **C. They were able to sight alien stars:** The text states that the stars in the alien cosmos looked \"alien\" and didn't match known constellations, making them unreliable for navigation.\n*   **D.

A species capable of regrowing tentacles that are lost in combat - The text doesn't mention this ability.\n*   C. Tentacled creatures with the ability to read each other's minds - This aligns well with the \"group-minded\" aspect. The interconnectedness of a group mind strongly suggests a form of telepathic communication or mental sharing.\n*   D.
