Sutton explains the dangers of implementing that idea immediately, emphasizing the need for careful population control and a long-term strategy.\n3. The text then describes the monster\u2019s movement and the disorientation Westover experiences.\n4. The last paragraph describes Sutton making a final farewell gesture as the monster begins to move away.\n\nGiven this sequence, Sutton is clearly moving *with* the monster as it begins its journey eastward. He is not close by, as Westover is clinging to its side, nor is he far away in space. He\u2019s also not dead, as he\u2019s actively saying goodbye. Therefore, he is far away on Earth (though moving with the monster).\n\nD"

Sutton argues that humans need to adapt to become parasites on the monsters to survive, mimicking the way tapeworms live. He believes that if humans kill the monsters, they\u2019ll eliminate their only food source and create a dangerous struggle for survival.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nD"

Humanity is desperately seeking refuge.\n\n2. **Monster Behavior:** The monsters are driven by instinct to move eastward, consuming everything in their path. They are essentially \"caterpillars\" eating a planet.\n\n3. **Westover's Experience:** He spends time living on the monster\u2019s back, observing its movement and physiology. He realizes the monsters are essentially moving towards the east.\n\n4. **Sutton\u2019s Reasoning:** Sutton explicitly states that the monsters will eventually migrate to a planet similar to Earth.\n\n5. **Evaluating Options:**\n   * **A. On a mountain:** Mountains offer some protection from the monsters\u2019 advance, but are still vulnerable to the flooding and general destruction.\n   * **B. On top of a monster:** This is where Westover spends a significant amount of time, and it's clearly not a safe long-term strategy. It\u2019s a moving target!\n   * **C. Where the monsters had already been:** Areas where the monsters had already passed would be ravaged and depleted of resources.\n   * **D. Where the monsters were headed:** This is the most logical choice. By predicting the monsters' trajectory, humanity could seek refuge *ahead* of them, in a relatively untouched area.\n\nTherefore, the safest place would be where the monsters were headed.\n\nD"

Humanity is facing extinction, and Westover is clinging to the side of one of these monsters, desperately seeking a way to survive.

The text states: \u201cHe had been following the high ground toward the hills, alternately splashing through waist-deep water and climbing onto comparatively dry knolls. To right and left of him was the sullen noise of the river in flood, and behind him, too, the rising water he had barely escaped. He had not sought in his mind for the flood\u2019s cause, but had merely taken it numbly as part of the fury and confusion of a world in ruin. Anyway, he was dead tired out on his feet.\u201d\n\nThe phrase \u201cdead tired out on his feet\u201d indicates physical exhaustion. The description of shrinking likely refers to his weakened state due to this fatigue. The other options are not supported by the text.\n\nD"

The passage states: \"Now he listened strainingly to the portentous sounds of change in the monster's vitals, and in a flash of insight knew them for what they were. The scientists had found, in the burst bodies of the Titans that had been killed by atomic bombs, the answer to the riddle of these creatures' crossing of space: great vacuoles, pockets of gas that in the living animal could be under exceedingly high pressures, and that could be expelled to drive the monster in flight like a reaction engine. Rocket propulsion, of course, was nothing new to zoology; it was developed ages before man, by the squids and by those odd degenerate relatives of the vertebrates that are called tunicates... The monster on which Westover had been living as a parasite was generating gases within itself, preparing to leave the ravished Earth.\u201d\n\nThis clearly indicates the monster was building up pressure within itself to propel itself into space.\n\nD"

Words like \"gigantic,\" \"devour,\" \"gutted,\" and \"ruin\" immediately create a sense of impending doom and despair. The description of the monster and the flood emphasizes the hopelessness of humanity's situation.\n\n2. **Shift Towards Scientific Observation (Lines 13-28):** As Westover begins to analyze the monster, the tone shifts slightly. There\u2019s a more detached, analytical quality introduced, reflecting a scientist\u2019s perspective. While still unsettling, there\u2019s a hint of intellectual curiosity.\n\n3. **Growing Despair & Psychological Strain (Lines 29-43):** The passage then returns to a darker tone, focusing on Westover\u2019s physical and mental deterioration as he climbs the monster\u2019s side. The descriptions of exhaustion, nightmares, and the insidious voice create a palpable sense of dread and isolation.\n\n4. **Unexpected Revelation & Hope (Lines 44-52):** The discovery of the monster's internal mechanisms and the possibility of parasitism sparks a significant shift. The tone becomes cautiously optimistic as Westover realizes a potential solution and a way forward. Sutton\u2019s pragmatic and somewhat cynical assessment balances this hope, but the ending carries a glimmer of possibility.\n\nConsidering this progression, the tone does shift. It doesn't become purely hopeful, but it moves from unrelieved bleakness to a cautious, strategic hopefulness.\n\nC"
