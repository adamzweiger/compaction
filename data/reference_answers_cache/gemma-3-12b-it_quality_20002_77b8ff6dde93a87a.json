Traits for kinship did not persist into modern day:** The passage explicitly states that genes for sibling, maternal, and paternal love *did* persist and permeate the species. So, this is incorrect.\n\n*   **B. Humans didn\u2019t understand genetics in early evolution:** The passage discusses how the principle of kin-selection arose *through* evolution, not in response to human understanding of genetics. This is not the point of confusion.\n\n*   **C. Humans are capable of treating anyone as kin:** The author *argues* that this is a good thing and a result of the breakdown of the rigid boundaries of kin selection. However, the confusion stems from the *unexpected* way kin-selection genes, originally intended for limited altruism, ended up spreading throughout the entire species.\n\n*   **D. Kin-selection would not have benefitted early humans:** The passage details *how* kin-selection benefitted early humans \u2013 by encouraging altruism towards relatives, which ultimately increased the survival of genes.\n\nThe most accurate answer is that the confusion comes from the fact that the \"selfish\" genes which initially favored love of kin have now spread throughout the entire species, meaning they sometimes promote altruism towards non-relatives, which is seemingly counterproductive to their own \"selfish\" genetic goals.\n\nC"

They point out examples like surrogate motherhood and adoption where bonding occurs despite a lack of genetic relationship.\n3. **Highlighting Bonding:** The author emphasizes the role of hormones (like oxytocin) in bonding and notes that adoptive parents can form strong attachments even without biological ties. They highlight that \"genetic relationship per se doesn't matter.\"\n4. **Concluding Argument:** The author concludes that love depends on a \"long and complex chain of bonding,\" not just genetic math.\n\nTherefore, the author argues that bonding is more important than genetic relationship in determining love.\n\nC"

The core of the argument is that the genes promoting familial love, initially successful because they encouraged altruism towards relatives (sharing genes), have now spread throughout the *entire* human population. This means that acting altruistically towards anyone, even a stranger, ultimately benefits the propagation of those same genes because you likely share a significant portion of your genes with them.\n\nNow, let\u2019s analyze the options:\n\n*   **A:** This is incorrect. The author argues the opposite - supporting relatives *did* initially help genes persist, but the key is that those genes are now widespread.\n*   **B:** This is also incorrect. The author explicitly states that modern humans *do* share most of their genes in common.\n*   **C:** This option accurately captures the author's argument. The author emphasizes that we fail to recognize how much we share genetically with all humans, and therefore, acting kindly to anyone can inadvertently benefit our genes.\n*   **D:** This is incorrect. The author focuses on the absurdity of limiting altruism to relatives when our genes are already dispersed throughout the population.\n\nC"

This example demonstrates that genes promoting love and altruism towards kin were favored because they increased the likelihood of those genes being passed on to future generations. The author states, \"Love triumphs...genes for sibling love come to permeate our species.\" This implies a significant and positive role for kin-selection.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the options:\n\n*   **A:** The passage explicitly contradicts this, describing early humans experiencing familial bonds.\n*   **B:** This aligns perfectly with the passage's explanation of Loving Bob and Loving Bob, and the subsequent spread of genes promoting kin-related altruism.\n*   **C:** The passage suggests the opposite; that altruism *developed* through kin selection, not that it was always present.\n*   **D:** The passage argues kinship traits were selected *for*, not against.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nB"

This allowed these genes to spread.\n*   **Spread Through the Population:** Over time, those genes for familial love became widespread throughout the entire human population.\n*   **Modern Relevance:** Because these genes are now so common, the author argues that restricting altruism solely to kin is actually *less* efficient for their own survival.

This suggests a strong understanding of genetics and evolutionary biology.\n2. **The Tone:** The author is conversational but also authoritative, readily correcting potential misunderstandings and presenting a nuanced argument. This implies expertise.\n3. **References and Knowledge:** The author references William Hamilton, discusses specific biological mechanisms, and is familiar with studies on oxytocin.
