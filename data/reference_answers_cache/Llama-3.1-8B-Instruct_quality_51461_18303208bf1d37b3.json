The dark star passed by the Earth, bringing eternal night and causing a significant change in the planet's environment.\n2. The dark star captured the Earth, pulling it into its orbit.\n3. The Sun managed to hold on to the Moon at the last minute, which implies that the Moon did not get captured by the dark star.\n\nConsidering these points, it is clear that the Moon was left behind when the Earth was captured by the dark star.\n\n**B**"

Water is mentioned as the first layer to freeze, making a 10-foot-thick blanket.\n3. After the water froze, the crystals of frozen air (which is a combination of gases) dropped down, making a 60-70 foot thick blanket.\n4. The story then mentions that the carbon dioxide was the first part of the air to freeze and drop down.\n5. Next, the nitrogen, being the largest part of the air, froze and dropped down.\n6. The oxygen, being the part that keeps the humans alive, is mentioned as being easy to get at and being on top of the nitrogen.\n7. Finally, the liquid helium is mentioned as being at the very top.\n\nSo, the correct order from bottom to top is: Water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, oxygen, helium.\n\n**D**"

When the boy tells his father about seeing the light, the father doesn't scold him for seeing things, but he does ask him not to tell the others, particularly the mother.\n3. The father explains to the boy that the mother has been trying to keep their spirits up and that they owe her the feeling of safety.\n\nConsidering these points, it can be inferred that the father wants to protect the mother from worrying or being scared, as she is already fragile emotionally.\n\n**B**"

A small star that had come down to Earth - This is not mentioned as the boy's initial impression, but rather a later thought.\nB. A hallucination - The text does not suggest that the boy was hallucinating.\nC. An instrument looking for life - There is no indication that the boy saw an instrument.\nD. A young lady's face - This is the boy's initial impression, but it is later corrected.\n\nGiven the boy's initial impression and the fact that it was later corrected, I'm going to guess that the boy saw a young lady's face, but the correct answer should be based on what he actually saw, which was a light.\n\nHowever, since the question asks what he saw and not what he thought he saw, I'll choose the option that best matches the description of what he saw.\n\nD"

They have grown accustomed to their small, self-sufficient space and the routines that come with it. The father, Pa, is the one who seems to be considering the possibility of leaving, but it's not a decision they take lightly.\n\nThe mother, Ma, is hesitant about leaving due to her feelings of hopelessness and fear of the unknown. She is concerned about how she would adapt to a new environment and interact with strangers.\n\nThe children, Harry and Sis, are also uncertain about leaving their home and the comfort it provides. Harry is scared of big places and strangers, and Sis is clinging to her mother.\n\nIt takes some time for the family to come to terms with the idea of leaving their home and joining the new community at Los Alamos or the uranium mines. They need to weigh the benefits of leaving, such as the possibility of meeting other survivors and having access to more resources, against their attachment to their current way of life.\n\n**C**"

They are using a fire to generate heat and a limited supply of air.\n\nConsidering these points, the reason the search party couldn't find the family with traditional communications is that there is no medium to carry signals. The Earth's atmosphere is gone, and there's a vacuum, making radio signals impossible.\n\n**D**"

The text mentions that Pa made their outside clothes, which have \"plastic headpieces that were once big double-duty transparent food cans, but they keep heat and air in and can replace the air for a little while.\"\n\nConsidering these points, it's clear that the characters need special gear to protect themselves from the cold outside, but the description of the gear is more primitive and homemade.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB"

He also mentions that she's been difficult lately, implying that she's struggling with her situation.\n\nPa is also shown to be the one who keeps the fire going and is the chief guardian of it, which suggests he's taking on a caregiving role. When Ma starts moaning again, Pa tries to calm her down and reassure her, showing a caring attitude towards her.\n\nAdditionally, when Pa is talking to the narrator, he mentions that Ma kept him trying when he was ready to give up and die, and that she nursed him and took care of the narrator and his sister when he was sick. This suggests a deep emotional connection and mutual support between Pa and Ma.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that Pa is like a caregiver for Ma, given her affliction.\n\nD"
