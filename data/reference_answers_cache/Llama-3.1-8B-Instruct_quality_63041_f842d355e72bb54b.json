He turned on his superior: This is true, as Lethla was the majordomo of Kriere, the All-Mighty.\n\nC.

The narrator, Sam Burnett, has been working as a coroner on a morgue ship for 10 years.\n3. The war has been ongoing for a long time, and the narrator has been involved in it since its beginning.\n4. The narrator mentions that the war has been \"see-sawing back and forth\" since the Venus-Earth conflict started.\n5. The narrator also mentions that there was a war concerning Io, which implies that the war between Earth and Venus is not the only conflict in the galaxy.\n\nConsidering this information, the war between Earth and Venus has been ongoing for at least a decade, as the narrator has been working on the morgue ship for 10 years. However, the narrator also mentions that the war has been ongoing since the conflict started, which suggests that the war may have begun even before the narrator started working on the morgue ship.\n\nGiven the options provided, the most accurate answer is:\n\nA"

Lethla, realizing the trick, fires at Burnett.\n4. Rice comes to fight Lethla, and Lethla is subdued.\n5.

Rice's voice is heard from the red darkness, and he is seen standing over Burnett.\n5. Burnett mentions that this is his last trip and that he meant it, implying that he is willing to sacrifice himself to end the war.\n\nGiven these events, it's likely that Rice is left alone on the ship, and the story suggests that he will continue the mission to fill the ship's cargo hold. This is supported by the fact that Burnett mentions that the ship is not yet full and that it's not right to return to Earth without a full cargo.\n\n \n\nD"

He had been collecting bodies for 10 years, and the thought of finally being able to capture Kriere, the leader of the war, and bring an end to the conflict was a strong motivation for him.\n\nHe realized that if he could capture Kriere, he could bring an end to the war and be free from his duties as a coroner on the morgue ship. This motivation is evident in his thoughts when he says, \"If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind searching.\"\n\n**A**"

The story mentions that the war has been going on for ten years, and the narrator is tired of his job.\n4. The war is mentioned as a major conflict involving many worlds, with the narrator referring to it as a \"galactic fury.\"\n\nGiven this information, we can infer that the war is a large-scale conflict between Earth and Venus, but the specific reasons for the war are not explicitly stated in the passage.\n\nHowever, the passage does mention that Lethla and Kriere were in a life-boat and were forced to take to the life-boats after their flag ship was attacked near Mars, and they set a time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket to avoid capture by the Earth cordon. This suggests that the war is a complex and intense conflict, with both sides engaging in combat and using desperate measures to avoid capture.\n\nSince the passage does not provide a clear reason for the war, and there is no indication that one side initiated the conflict, the best answer is:\n\nB"

Burnett is described as a veteran of the job, having been doing it for 10 years, while Rice is new to the job. This is evident from Rice's reaction to Burnett's experience and his comment, \"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\" which suggests that Burnett has been doing the job for a long time.\n\n3. Burnett is described as a man in his 40s or 50s, with \"huge, red, soft hands\" and a worn face. Rice, on the other hand, is described as young, with a \"sharp-cut face\" and \"hot, black\" eyes.\n\n4. Burnett's cynicism is evident in his attitude towards the war and his job. He has been doing the job for 10 years and has seen the horrors of war up close, which has made him jaded and detached. Rice, on the other hand, is more idealistic, as evident from his reaction to Lethla's plan to rescue Kriere.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that is not true about the differences between Rice and Burnett is:\n\nA.

Burnett's actions suggest that he believes killing Kriere will stop the war, as he's willing to take a risk to do so.\n3. Burnett's decision to kill Kriere is motivated by his desire to fill the ship's morgue with 100 bodies, but this is not the primary reason; it's more of a secondary motivation to fulfill his mission.\n4. Burnett's actions imply that he thinks killing Kriere will make Lethla easier to take down, as Lethla's gun is a significant threat.\n\nConsidering these points, Burnett's primary motivation for killing Kriere is not to fulfill his mission by filling the ship's morgue, but rather to stop the war by eliminating its leader.
