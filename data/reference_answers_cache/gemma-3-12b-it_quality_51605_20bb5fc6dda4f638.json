      "generated_text": "Here's the step-by-step thought process:\n\n1. The story states that Mrs. Jamieson and her son moved to Wisconsin \"back in '07\".\n2. It then says Earl became a Konv when he was fourteen.\n3. Therefore, the year Earl became a Konv is 1907 + 14 = 1921.\n4. The difference in years is 1921 - 1907 = 14 years.\n5. The problem asks how many years passed between moving to Wisconsin and Earl becoming a Konv. The problem also states \"Several times in the past seven years Mrs. Jamieson had seen other Konvs,\" which implies that 7 years passed before Earl started to have experiences related to his Konv abilities.\n6. Looking at the options, the best fit is 7.\n\nB"

She hated the agents:** While she does harbor strong hatred for the agents, this isn't presented as the primary reason for staying.\n*   **B. She loved her husband:** This is a significant factor. The story emphasizes her devotion to her late husband and her desire to honor his memory. However, it doesn't explicitly state this prevents her from joining Earl.\n*   **C. She loved her son:** This is a factor but she doesn't express a strong reason for staying to protect him.\n*   **D. She was afraid to go:** The text doesn't indicate fear was a factor.\n\nThe most crucial piece of information is the final paragraph where it's revealed her power was gone. This implies she could no longer utilize a Konv cylinder to travel. Her power disappearing is what prevented her from going, and that is intrinsically linked to her past and the events surrounding her husband.\n\nB"

However, it states they would go to Centaurus *after* college.\n* **Option C: After he finished college:** The story explicitly states, \"They would go to Centaurus after Earl had finished college.\" This aligns perfectly.\n* **Option D: When he was 14:** Earl briefly disappears at age 14, but this is his initial activation as a Konv, not a journey to space.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nC"

This means he wasn't born one.\n*   **Option B: He wasn't born human.** This is true, but it doesn't explain *why* he wished to be human. It's a statement of fact, not a reason.\n*   **Option C: He had no friends at university.** While he mentions not having friends, this is a consequence of his Konv identity, not the core reason he wanted to be human. He feels isolated, but it's not the driving force.\n*   **Option D: He liked a girl.** He mentions Lorane Peters and wishing he could ask her to a basketball game \"just as if I was human.\" This reveals a desire for normalcy and connection that being a Konv prevented.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is D.\n\nD"

She had to hide her scar:** While the scar is mentioned, it\u2019s primarily a symbol of her Konv identity and a minor detail compared to the central conflict.\n\nMrs. Jamieson's biggest problem was the constant threat posed by the Agents and her desire to protect her son while also seeking revenge for her husband's death. This leads to her loss of power and ultimately, her death. The hiding of the scar and financial struggles are secondary to this primary conflict.\n\nD"

She maintained a low profile and avoided drawing attention to herself for many years, which included not using the cylinder frequently. This lack of use likely led to its malfunction without her realizing it until the very end.\n*   **D. She never learned how to use the cylinder:** The story makes it clear she *did* know how to use it, having used it to escape and later to kill an Agent.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C.\n\nC"

She learned that he was an Agent completely by accident. While cleaning the cabin one morning his badge fell out of a shirt pocket.\"\n\nThis means she discovered his identity accidentally, by finding his badge. The text continues, \"She threw the weapon into the river. It helped very little. He was one Agent, only one out of all the thousands of Agents all over Earth; while her husband had been one of twenty-eight persons. She decided then that her efforts would be too ineffective. The odds were wrong. She would wait until her son, Earl, was grown.\"\n\nThis reveals that her motive was revenge for her husband's death, and discovering he was an Agent triggered this.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nD"

When you travel with the cylinder you arrive nude:** The story states, \"One disadvantage of this method of travel was that, while a body could travel instantaneously to any chosen spot, it arrived without clothes.\" This directly explains why Earl appeared nude.\n*   **D.

Agents are adversaries:** While the story depicts Agents as antagonists, the mother's later discussion with Earl reveals a more nuanced view. She acknowledges they are not inherently evil and that some are driven by a desire for order.\n*   **B. Not all Agents are bad people:** This aligns with the conversation where the Agent in Bangkok explains their motives and reveals a sense of shared values. The mother encourages Earl to understand this perspective.\n*   **C. To study hard and follow his heart:** While the mother encourages Earl to study, it's primarily for practical reasons related to contributing on Centaurus, not a lesson about following his heart.\n*   **D. To become an engineer so he is needed on Centaurus:** This is a stated goal, but not a foundational lesson or value she's trying to instill.\n\nThe most significant takeaway is the nuanced understanding that not all Agents are inherently bad and that they too have motivations and a desire for order. This contrasts with the initial, purely hateful view she held.\n\nB"

However, Mrs. Jamieson's power unexpectedly vanishes, and she is killed by the Agents. The story ends with her death and no mention of Earl's fate.

Again, he is brought to a location, not rescued from one.\n3. **Third instance:** At the very end, Benjamin and Mrs. Jamieson attempt to teleport away, but only Mrs. Jamieson's power fails.
