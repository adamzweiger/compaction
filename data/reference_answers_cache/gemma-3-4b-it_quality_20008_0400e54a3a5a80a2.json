The author initially dismisses the idea that race is a determining factor in athletic success.\n2.  They point out that African and Asian athletes are disproportionately represented on the Olympic podium, but this is due to environmental factors \u2013 training, access to resources, and historical circumstances \u2013 not inherent genetic differences.\n3.  They cite the example of China\u2019s success in distance running after a deliberate investment in athletic development, demonstrating that training can overcome perceived racial limitations.\n4.  The author emphasizes the difficulty of experimentally testing racial differences in athletic ability due to confounding environmental variables.\n\nConsidering these points, the most accurate statement is that the author argues that athletic ability is most likely due to environment and training rather than race.\n\nD"

He specifically addresses this by pointing out that natural selection, as it applies to athletics, is now working *against* athletes due to the demands of training and the decreasing reproductive rates of top performers. The author suggests that breeding for enhanced athletic ability is counterproductive because athletes are less likely to have children and that even if they do, the rigorous training regime can negatively impact their reproductive success.\n\nD.
