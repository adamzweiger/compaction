Qornt are described as argumentive, boastful, and lacking appreciation for the finer things in life. They revel in battle.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Options:**\n   * **A. A passive Verpp:** Passive individuals, by definition, avoid conflict. This aligns well with the Verpp\u2019s general nature and would likely be the least warlike.\n   * **B. A calm Verpp:** Calmness is a good trait, but it doesn't necessarily equate to a lack of desire for conflict. \n   * **C. An angry Verpp:** Anger is the opposite of what the Verpp are described as.\n   * **D. A happy Verpp:** Happiness isn\u2019t directly related to warlike tendencies.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Considering the established characteristics of both Qornt and Verpp, a passive Verpp is the most logical choice for the least warlike individual.\n\nD"
