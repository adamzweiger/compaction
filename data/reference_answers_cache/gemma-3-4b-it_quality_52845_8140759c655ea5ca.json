The text then jumps to \"the hill was a memory-image and Aldebaran 12 rain-country hills were notoriously steep.\" This further reinforces the passage of time. Finally, the text indicates he\u2019s tracking Sabrina York after a \"few minutes\" of deliberation.\n\nConsidering the information, 10 hours seems like a reasonable estimate for the time between Blake\u2019s night with Eldoria and his subsequent search.\n\nD"

The passage states that Blake Past feels guilty about buying Deirdre after her parents died and wants to alleviate that guilt by suggesting she go to the prom with the young man. This directly suggests that Blake is acting like a father figure, which is a painful reminder of her parents\u2019 loss. The passage explicitly mentions this discomfort and Deirdre\u2019s reaction to Blake\u2019s attempt to play that role.\n\nA. Because Blake is trying to guilt Deirdre into going with the young man by telling her that it'll ease her conscience.\nB. Because Deirdre has fallen in love with Blake, despite his age, and wants him to take her to the prom.\nC. Because Blake is acting like he's her father, which is a sensitive topic for Deirdre because she lost her real parents.\nD. Because the young man gave up his right arm in order to afford tickets to the prom, and this disgusts Deirdre.\n\nThe most accurate answer is C.\n\nC"

The text states, \"Shame flamed in Blake's cheeks, and for a moment he considered leaving; then he remembered Eldoria's dance, and he went right on sitting where he was.\" This suggests a conflict between his feelings for Eldoria and his awareness of Deirdre\u2019s presence and knowledge.\n\nOption A: He is embarrassed at the thought that Deirdre might enter the room while he is sleeping with Eldoria. This is plausible, as it highlights a potential awkwardness and a feeling of being observed.\n\nOption B: He feels that prostitution is morally reprehensible. While the situation certainly involves exploitation, the immediate cause of his shame isn\u2019t explicitly about the morality of prostitution; it\u2019s about his actions and the awareness of Deirdre.\n\nOption C: He feels guilty about sleeping with Eldoria when there's a child in the hut, Deirdre, who knows exactly what's going on. This resonates strongly with the passage\u2019s focus on Deirdre\u2019s awareness and Blake's discomfort with being caught in this situation. The fact that she\u2019s a child adds a layer of guilt.\n\nOption D: He feels guilty about wishing Deirdre was older so he could sleep with her instead. This is a personal desire, but not the primary reason for his shame as described in the passage.\n\nConsidering the emphasis on Deirdre\u2019s awareness and the implied emotional weight of the situation, option C is the most accurate.\n\nC"

The passage explicitly states that Blake created the office as a \u201csentimental memory,\u201d and that it was linked to feelings of guilt related to his actions in the past \u2013 specifically, buying Sabrina York after Eldoria\u2019s death. He felt it was an attempt to ease his conscience. The woman embodying the \"Velvetskin\" image represents a specific commercial entity (a detergent brand), implying a nagging sense of regret and perhaps exploitation associated with his past endeavors. The other figures (Stoddart and Finch) seem to represent aspects of his past that he wanted to suppress or avoid confronting. It\u2019s about a deeply-rooted guilt stemming from his past actions and their consequences.\n\nD"

The passage focuses on his immediate reaction to Eldoria \u2013 her beauty, her dance, and the unsettling feeling he has about her. He's clearly captivated and somewhat intimidated.\n\n*   **A. He's afraid that if he angers her, she'll revert to the cannibalism of her forebears.** This is a plausible explanation. The passage emphasizes the \"lascivious\" nature of her dance and her lineage. Blake\u2019s reaction suggests a heightened awareness of potential danger and a desire to avoid provoking her.\n\n*   **B. He knows she needs the money to move out of her chocoletto hut.** The passage doesn\u2019t offer any information about her financial situation or motivations.\n\n*   **C. He has been making a lot of money as a private pyscheye and can afford the high price.** While plausible, this isn\u2019t the primary reason given in the text. The focus is on his fascination and unease, not his financial status.\n\n*   **D. He has never seen anyone like her, and after seeing her dance, he believes she's worth the price.** This aligns perfectly with the passage. His description of her as \u201cnever seen anyone quite like her\u201d and his immediate acceptance of her price demonstrate a sense of value and a willingness to pay, driven by his immediate attraction.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D.\n\nD"

The shame is linked to the fact that she knew why he was there and that he was waiting for Eldoria. The description of the hut as \u201cuncared for\u201d and giving a \u201cfalse impression of poverty\u201d reinforces the feeling that he was intruding in a space that wasn\u2019t meant for him.\n\nConsidering the options:\n\n*   **A. He had not been invited.** While this might be a contributing factor, the primary feeling is more about his behavior and the situation.\n*   **B. The hut demonstrated poverty.** The passage explicitly mentions the hut giving a false impression of poverty, which would contribute to his awkwardness.\n*   **C. He was ashamed a young girl knew why he was there.** This directly aligns with the passage's description of \u201cshame flamed in Blake\u2019s cheeks.\u201d\n*   **D.

This suggests he sees himself as a powerful creator within his own mind.\n3. **The evidence:** He's able to manipulate the environment of his mind-country, bringing memories to life, constructing buildings, and even creating figures like the vengeful Stoddart, Finch, and Velvetskin \u2013 beings that didn't exist in reality but were born from his own consciousness.\n4. **Analyzing the options:**\n   * **A. He has the ability to create beings at will:** This is the most accurate explanation. The creation of the vengeful women directly supports this.\n   * **B. He is righteous:** The passage doesn't suggest Blake is inherently good or righteous; he's simply a powerful creator.\n   * **C. He chases and apprehends criminals:** This describes his profession, not his self-perception.\n   * **D. He is alive while his mom is dead:** While this is a personal and poignant detail for Blake, it doesn\u2019t explain his feeling of being a god.\n\n**D**"
