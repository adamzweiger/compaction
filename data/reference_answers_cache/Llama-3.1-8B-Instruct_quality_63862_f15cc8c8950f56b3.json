This implies that she is trying to appear defenseless.\n2. There is no mention of her having telepathic or magical abilities.\n3. The text does not mention any active communication with the mentors.\n4. Evelyn does use a beam gun to kill the Tharn corporal, but it's not mentioned as a key defense weapon in the context of her interactions with the inquisitor and Perat.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that Evelyn's key defense is her ability to appear defenseless, which allows her to manipulate those around her, including the inquisitor and Perat.\n\nA. \nC."

It is mentioned that the globes, \"The Defender\" and \"The Invader\", had a battle where \"hordes of brute-men poured through the crushed outer armor of the stricken Defender.\"\n3. The text states that \"The Invader\" was a Scythian globe that \"sprang out of black space to enslave the budding Terran Confederacy.\"\n\nFrom this information, we can infer that the globes were engaged in a battle, with one side (The Invader) attempting to conquer the other (The Defender), which was defending its territory.\n\n**D**"

Perat uses Evelyn as a plaything, having her dance for him and manipulate her to do his bidding.\n4. Perat is aware of Evelyn's true nature, but he is not concerned about her deception.\n5. Perat's actions suggest that he is in control of the relationship, and Evelyn is being used for his own amusement.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA"

The proton storm caused the globes to lose their bearings.\n3.

The story mentions \"two mighty metal globes\" that are in a \"murderous death-struggle\", suggesting that they are large, solid objects.\n2. The globes are described as having \"outer armor\" and \"inner portions\" that can be accessed, implying a layered structure.\n3. The protagonist, Evelyn, is in a \"cubicle\" within one of the globes, which is a small, enclosed space with a \"cot\", an \"oxygen valve\", and a \"relay\" that controls the prime movers.\n4. The globes are referred to as \"battle globes\", suggesting that they are designed for combat and likely have interior spaces for crew and equipment.\n5. The fact that the globes have a \"heart\" (the votron) and \"prime movers\" suggests that they are self-contained, self-sustaining systems with internal mechanisms.\n\nConsidering these points, the most likely anatomy of the inhabited spacecrafts in the story is that they are crafted planets made to be much like Earth with spaceship components within to propel them.\n\nD"

Evelyn is a skilled fighter, able to take down a Tharn soldier with a telepathic paralysis and a slash to the throat, indicating she is brave and competent.\n2. While Evelyn is able to think quickly and adapt to situations, there is no evidence of her being particularly funny or generous.\n3. Evelyn's actions are primarily driven by her goal of detonating the pile and ending the war, rather than a desire to be seen as selfless or pretty.\n4. Evelyn is careful to consider her actions and their potential consequences, such as when she decides to pretend to be a Terran woman and uses her telepathic abilities to deceive the inquisitor and others. She also takes care to avoid drawing attention to herself, such as by not revealing her true identity or intentions.\n\nGiven these characteristics, the best description of Evelyn Kane is:\n\nD"

There's no mention of Evelyn wanting the prisoner to escape, so option B is unlikely.\n3. There's no mention of the prisoner being her uncle, so option C is also unlikely.\n4. The text states that Evelyn's eyes met the prisoner's, and she felt a \"horrid chill creeping over her\" and that \"she felt a moment that she needed only to wish hard enough, and this would be a dream.\" This suggests that she recognizes the prisoner and is emotionally affected by his presence.\n\nBased on this analysis, it's likely that the prisoner is someone close to Evelyn, and the most plausible relationship is that he's her father.\n\n**D**"

The universe is characterized by a high level of violence, with scenes of prisoners being shot, and the protagonist herself having to kill a man to save her father.\n5. The society is hierarchical, with a ruling class and a lower class, indicating social inequality and potential for exploitation.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that living in this universe would be challenging and hazardous, with a high level of danger and uncertainty.\n\nD"

Initially, she is trying to survive and fulfill her duty to destroy the planet. However, she also shows empathy and compassion, especially when she encounters her father. Her actions are not purely driven by self-interest, and she is willing to risk her life to help others.\n\n2. Perat, Viscount of Tharn: He is a ruthless and cruel character who enjoys killing and is willing to do so himself, even if it's against his orders. He seems to lack empathy and is driven by a desire for stimulation and power.\n\n3. Gordon, Lord Kane: He is Evelyn's father, and his actions are heroic. He is willing to sacrifice himself to save others and protect his daughter.\n\n4. The Scythian corporal: He is a minor character, but his actions are driven by his orders and a desire to follow protocol. He does not show any notable empathy or compassion.\n\n5. S'ria Gorph: He is a minor character who seems to be more concerned with his own career advancement than with the welfare of others. He is not particularly cruel, but he is not heroic either.\n\n6. S'ria Gerek: She is a minor character who seems to be a loyal and obedient follower of the Scythian occupation. Her actions and motivations are not well-developed in the story.\n\nConsidering these characters, I would guess that there is one honorable character in the story.\n\nD"
