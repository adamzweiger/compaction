He had built a relationship with the Thrid and had hopes of one of them, Ganti, taking over the trading post, which would decrease the cost of doing business and eliminate human-Thrid friction.\n\nHe was angry because Glen-U, the Grand Panjandrum, ordered Jorgenson to give over all his business to him, which would essentially ruin Jorgenson's business.\n\nGlen-U's demand was not just about taking over Jorgenson's business, but also about Jorgenson's refusal to acknowledge Glen-U as infallible, which was a key part of Thrid culture.\n\nJorgenson's anger was also personal, as he had a particular dislike for Glen-U's regime and the way it treated its citizens, including Ganti, who had been a victim of the system.\n\nConsidering these points, the reason for Jorgenson's anger is not explicitly stated in the text as B, C, or D, but it can be inferred that his anger was partly due to Glen-U making his business suffer, and partly due to his personal feelings about Glen-U's regime.\n\nHowever, given the options provided, the closest answer would be B. He needed his business to support his family."

The Thrid have a social system where officials, particularly the Grand Panjandrum, are believed to be infallible and cannot make mistakes.\n2. The Grand Panjandrum's words are considered absolute truth, as seen in the scene where Jorgenson is told that if the Grand Panjandrum says something, it is true.\n3. The Thrid's concept of truth is not based on observation or scientific evidence, as they do not use missile weapons and have a primitive technology level.\n4. The Thrid's stories and culture do not seem to be a source of truth, as they are not mentioned as having any significance in the context of the story.\n\nBased on this analysis, the Thrid's definition of truth seems to be closely tied to the authority and power of those in charge.\n\n**B**"

However, it is mentioned that \"It would be a nice situation for Glen-U. He'd have to do something about it, and there was nothing he could do.\" This implies that Glen-U's mistake would be public knowledge, and he would be forced to take action.\n\nJorgenson was then sent to the island, but it is not because he was put to death, but rather because he was to be confined. This suggests that the Thrid did not want to kill Jorgenson, but rather isolate him.\n\nGanti, who had previously been conditioned to believe that the officials were always right, was also sent to the island. It is not explicitly stated that they were kept alive for any specific reason, but their situation is presented as a form of punishment.\n\nConsidering the context, it seems that the Thrid did not want to kill Jorgenson and Ganti, but rather isolate them.

However, both were operating within the constraints of their own logic, where they believed that their conclusions were correct because they fit within their own understanding of the rules.\n\nA and C seem to be incorrect because the text suggests that Jorgenson was more open to new ideas, and the Thrid were conditioned to follow rules. D seems to be incorrect because Jorgenson's reasoning was more intuitive and emotional, whereas the Thrid's reasoning was more rigid and rule-based.\n\nB seems to be the most fitting answer. Jorgenson's reasoning, as a business man, involved swallowing the Grand Panjandrum's declaration and acting accordingly, rather than questioning it. Similarly, the Thrid were conditioned to believe that the Grand Panjandrum was right, and they did not question it. Both Jorgenson and the Thrid were not nuanced in their thinking, in the sense that they did not consider multiple perspectives or alternative explanations.\n\n**B**"

Jorgenson is described as seeing things as both a businessman and as right and wrong, which indicates that he has a dual perspective.\n2. He is frustrated with the social system on Thriddar, which suggests that his feelings of right and wrong are being challenged by the actions of the Thrid.\n3. He likes the Thrid, but dislikes their officials, which indicates that his conflict is not about the people themselves, but about their system of government.\n4. He is particularly upset about what happened to Ganti, which suggests that his feelings of injustice are personal and emotional.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that Jorgenson's internal conflict is not primarily about making money or personal gain, but about his values and sense of justice.\n\nA is incorrect because it doesn't capture the emotional aspect of his conflict.\nB is incorrect because there is no indication that Jorgenson wants to give his trading post to the Grand Panjandrum.\nC is incorrect because it implies that Jorgenson is motivated by self-interest, which is not the primary driver of his conflict.\nD is the correct answer because it accurately captures Jorgenson's internal conflict as a struggle between his rational, businesslike persona and his emotional response to the injustices of Thriddar's society."

The text states that the governor says Ganti's wife wants to enter his household, and Ganti's wife wants to yield to him. This suggests that the governor is using manipulation or coercion to take Ganti's wife.\n2. Ganti is described as being conditioned to believe that when a governor says he wants to do something, he does. This implies that Ganti has been taught to obey authority without question.\n3. The text also states that Ganti \"moped horribly\" after his wife's transfer, which suggests that he is upset and distressed by the loss of his wife.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that Ganti is not in a position to resist the governor's decision due to his conditioning and the fact that the governor is using manipulation to take his wife. The correct answer is not that Ganti doesn't care about his wife or that he thinks the governor will give him a promotion. It is also not that he thinks his wife will be happier with the governor, as there is no indication of this in the text.\n\nGanti's actions are motivated by his conditioning to obey authority, which is a key aspect of Thrid culture.
