She\u2019s described as \u201csneaky\u201d and \u201cdeceptive,\u201d quickly revealing herself to be an imposter. The initial reactions of Darling Toujours and Carlton E.

She stated, \u201cI know exactly what you intended to do\u2014to board the\nKismet\n, searching for only one person, Darling Toujours. I guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping and holding for ransom.\u201d This suggests a deliberate plan and prior knowledge of Darling\u2019s value to the pirates. It also implies a reason for Darling being a target.\n\nNow let's examine the options:\n\n*   **A. Darling used to date one of the pirates:** The text doesn\u2019t mention any romantic relationship between Darling and the pirates.\n*   **B. She closed their space flight business:** The text indicates they were shut out by STAR due to a monopoly, not that Darling directly closed their business.\n*   **C. Some of the pirates worked on film sets with Darling:** The text states she \u201cwas credited with being the most beautiful woman alive\u201d and \u201cworked for a studio,\u201d suggesting a connection to the film industry, but doesn\u2019t specify that any pirates worked *with* her.\n*   **D. There was no relation prior to their kidnapping:** This is contradicted by Grandma Perkins' actions and statements, clearly showing a pre-existing connection and a calculated strategy.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D.\n\nD"
