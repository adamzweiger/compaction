The Boyars have been terraforming the planet and have a well-established settlement, indicating a history of interaction and potentially conflict.\n\nThe Aga Kaga has been expanding its territory for five years, and the Boyars are aware of this expansion. The Aga Kaga has already landed detachments of \"fishermen\" and \"homesteaders\" on Flamme, indicating a recent escalation of the conflict.\n\nThere is no indication that the Boyars and the Aga Kaga have been at war for thousands of years, which makes option A unlikely.\n\nWhile the Boyars and the Aga Kaga do have a conflict, there is no indication that they are ruled by similar systems of governance, which makes option C unlikely.\n\nGiven the context, option D \"They have never before been at war\" seems unlikely, as the Aga Kaga has been expanding its territory into the Boyars' land, and the Boyars are aware of this expansion.\n\nBased on the information provided, the most accurate option is B. They are newly engaged in violent conflict."

The Boyars have spent sixty years terraforming Flamme, clearing jungle, descumming seas, irrigating deserts, and setting out forests.\n\nGiven this information, it can be inferred that the Boyars have been on Flamme for at least sixty years. However, the text also mentions that they have just about reached the point where they can begin to enjoy the fruits of their labor, suggesting that they have been on Flamme for more than sixty years.\n\nConsidering the options provided, the closest estimate would be two centuries."

The Aga Kaga mentions that he uses the title \"Excellency\" and other formal titles to please \"some of the old fools\" in his government, implying that he is aware of the historical significance of these titles and may not be a traditional holder of the position.\n3. The Aga Kaga mentions that his advisors believe in \"primitive plumbing,\" suggesting that they may be traditionalists who value old ways, and that the Aga Kaga may not be a traditionalist himself.\n4. The Aga Kaga's words and actions suggest that he is a pragmatic and realistic leader who is more concerned with achieving his goals than with maintaining traditional power structures.\n\nBased on these observations, I would guess that Stanley is an outsider who has risen to power within the Aga Kagan, possibly through his own merit or due to a change in the political climate.\n\n**C**"

The Under-Secretary's response to Retief's concerns is evasive and dismissive, indicating a lack of decisiveness or aggression.\n3.

Direct - The note is formal, but it does not directly state its intention or opinion in a straightforward manner. It is more diplomatic and indirect.\nB. Bellicose - The tone of the note is not aggressive or threatening, so this option does not fit.\nC.
