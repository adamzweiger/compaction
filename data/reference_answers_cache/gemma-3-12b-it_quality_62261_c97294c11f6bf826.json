However, this seems more like a grumpy facade than genuine animosity.\n*   **Mentorship:** Kerry is described as having \"taken the youngster in hand to give him the benefits of experience.\" This indicates a mentor-mentee dynamic.\n*   **Friendship Development:** Despite the initial bickering, the text reveals a growing warmth and camaraderie between them, demonstrated by laughter and concern for each other's well-being.\n*   **Respect:** Splinter acknowledges Kerry\u2019s experience and skill, while Kerry seems to find a kindred spirit in Splinter.\n\nConsidering these points, the most accurate description is that Kerry is a veteran who took Splinter under his wing.\n\nD"

This is a significant medical event.\n\nTherefore, Kerry receives the most medical intervention.\n\nD"

It's bigger than just two bunks, and it's not large enough to carry other ships. It appears suitable for a small crew, primarily two people, with limited functionality.\n\nB."

This strongly suggests a jungle-covered landscape.\n\nNow let's consider the other options:\n\nB. Exposed continental plates are unlikely given the description of jungle growth.\nC.

It also states that \"official reports say that there is no light on Venus\" and that the ocean glows due to tiny worms, creating a diffused light. This suggests visibility is extremely limited.\n\n*   **A. Only by sight:** This is unlikely given the dense cloud cover and lack of sunlight.\n*   **B. Radar:** While not explicitly stated, it's the most logical method for navigating in such conditions.\n*   **C. Using a search and rescue flight pattern:** This implies they're lost, and the story doesn't present that situation.\n*   **D. Using magnetic poles:** The text provides no information related to Venus's magnetic poles.\n\nTherefore, radar seems to be the most probable method.\n\nB"

Angry with him that they had crashed:** While Splinter initially expresses some dismay at the crash, it's not portrayed as anger towards Kerry. He's more focused on the situation and assessing what to do.\n*   **B. Terrified to be alone with him:** There's no indication of fear regarding Kerry's presence. They maintain a somewhat playful, albeit tense, dynamic.\n*   **C. Pitiful that he had broken his arm:** Splinter expresses concern and helps Kerry with a splint, but the dominant feeling isn't pity. It's more of a supportive response.\n*   **D. Relieved to have his experience at hand:** Splinter seems impressed by Kerry\u2019s competence and relies on his experience. He\u2019s happy to have Kerry\u2019s knowledge as they face the situation on the island.

He seemed to be yearning for a return to his active days, suggesting a desire to feel like his old self.\n*   **B. He was strictly following orders:** While he did receive orders, the text emphasizes his initial unhappiness with the assignment and his grumbling, indicating he wasn't motivated solely by obedience.\n*   **C. He didn\u2019t care whether he lived or died:** The text doesn't suggest any suicidal tendencies or apathy towards his own life.\n*   **D. He thought that Splinter would screw it up alone:** While he expresses some annoyance with Splinter, it's not presented as a primary reason for his participation.\n\nTherefore, the most compelling reason based on the text is that Kerry sought a return to his former identity and purpose.\n\nA"

He thinks he doesn't need the pills because he never took them when he was younger:** The text highlights Kerry Blane's experience and his feeling of being an old-timer, but doesn't specifically mention that he believes he's above needing vitamins.\n*   **C. He thinks the pills are only for new pilots:** While he does mock Splinter for being a \"young squirt,\" it's not explicitly stated that he believes the pills are solely for new pilots.\n*   **D. He thinks the pills do more harm than good:** Kerry Blane expresses a general distaste for the pills and consistently resists taking them, showing a distrust of their benefits. The ultimate reveal that the pills contributed to the ship's malfunction supports this interpretation - he avoided them and a faulty one ended up causing the crash.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is that he distrusts the pills and believes they are more trouble than they are worth.\n\nD"

He misses flying spacecraft too much to quit:** The text says \"Something died within Kerry Blane's heart that morning\" upon retirement and that he \"dry-rotted\" in a desk job, suggesting he wasn't fulfilled. This aligns with missing flying.\n*   **D. He is called back to fly spacecraft because he is one of the best pilots:** The text mentions he was given a desk job \"as a last resort so that he would not be thrown entirely aside.\" While he is recognized as a skilled pilot, he wasn't actively *called* back.\n\nOption C is the most closely aligned with the text's description of Kerry Blane's feelings about retirement and his subsequent willingness to participate in the mission.\n\nC"

His experience doesn't directly help avoid space bends *without* pills.\n*   **C. He knows how to communicate with the protoplasm they are supposed to kill:** There's no mention of Kerry Blane having any communication skills with the creature.\n*   **D. He knows that solar charged weapons will not work on Venus:** The story reveals that Kerry Blane remembers and realizes the solar-powered weapons are useless because the thick clouds block sunlight. This is a key realization.\n\nTherefore, Kerry Blane's knowledge that solar-powered weapons are ineffective due to the cloud cover is the most significant contribution stemming from his experience.\n\nD"
