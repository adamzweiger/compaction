Once a week he goes up on the roof to check if it\u2019s working all right. That's our worst trip and Pa won't let me make it alone.\u201d and \u201cHe said to me, son, \u2018If you see something like that again, don't tell the others. Your Ma\u2019s sort of nervous these days and we owe her all the feeling of safety we can give her. Once\u2014it was when your sister was born\u2014I was ready to give up and die, but your Mother kept me trying.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis clearly indicates that the father was trying to shield his wife from fear and anxiety. He valued her emotional stability and wanted to avoid upsetting her.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the options:\n*   A. He didn\u2019t want to hear her throw fits about it. - While this might be a consequence, it's not the primary reason.\n*   B. He wanted to protect her like she had protected him - This aligns perfectly with the passage's emphasis on shielding her from fear.\n*   C. He knew there was no one out there - The passage describes unsettling sightings, suggesting he wasn\u2019t certain.\n*   D. He didn\u2019t want her to be hopeful someone was coming - This is a possible side effect, but less central than his desire to protect her.\n\n**B**"

The air is incredibly thin, frozen, and filled with layers of ice and gases. Radio waves, which rely on an atmosphere to propagate, wouldn't be able to travel effectively through this environment. Furthermore, the passage explicitly states, \"There's no sound outside in the vacuum.\" The lack of a medium to carry signals\u2014the atmosphere\u2014is the primary reason communication is impossible.\n\nA. Signals are disrupted by the electromagnetic events of the dark star \u2013 While the dark star's effects are mentioned, the core issue isn\u2019t disruption of signals themselves, but the absence of a medium.\nB. The family couldn\u2019t hear them because they were underground \u2013 The passage doesn\u2019t indicate the family\u2019s location relative to the search party\u2019s equipment.\nC.
