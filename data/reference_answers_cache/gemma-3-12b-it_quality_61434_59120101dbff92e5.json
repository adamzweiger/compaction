It was too small:** The description suggests a \"village,\" which implies a reasonable size, not something minuscule.\n*   **C. It was camouflaged:** The text explicitly states, \"It appears the Qornt do not share that opinion,\" referring to the planet being Terrestrial territory, but later mentions, \u201cCamouflaged.\u201d This suggests the village was hidden.\n*   **D.

He thought they would be ignored:** This aligns with the text, where Zubb states that \"no one will take any notice of you\" and suggests a lack of concern from the Qornt regarding the Terrestrials.\n*   **C. He wanted them to be honored guests:** The situation described is far from a welcoming or honored guest scenario; they are essentially led into a potentially dangerous situation.\n*   **D. He wanted them to negotiate a surrender:** There's no mention of surrender being the goal of the visit.\n\nTherefore, the most logical reason based on the text is that Zubb thought the men would be ignored.\n\nB"

Incorrect - The text explicitly describes them as a \"warlike race,\" not mediators.\n   * C. Incorrect - The text doesn't portray them as gods.\n   * D. Correct - This option accurately reflects Nitworth's description of them as a \"warlike race\" that disappeared.\n\nD"

The story ends with Retief proposing a deal and the Qornt reaffirming their intention to invade, suggesting the situation is far from resolved.\n\n*   **A. They need to flee the planet to be safe:** While fleeing might seem logical given the threat, the story doesn't indicate a sudden shift toward prioritizing safety above all else. Retief is still attempting to negotiate and manage the situation.\n*   **B. They will stand and fight against them:** The story shows reluctance to fight, with the focus on diplomacy and avoiding conflict. A full-scale fight isn't the immediate plan.\n*   **C. Magnan needs the experience involved in a recon mission:** The ambassador expresses frustration with Magnan and assigns him a reconnaissance mission to Roolit I, as a way to get him some field experience, however that was *before* the full scope of the Qornt's plan became apparent. The story doesn't indicate a change in plans after this point.\n*   **D. Retief has to confront them due to a punishment he receives:** There is no indication of a punishment being received by Retief. The story ends with him taking charge and attempting to negotiate.\n\nGiven the story\u2019s trajectory and Retief\u2019s proactive approach, and the Ambassador's previous instruction about Magnan's experience, option C seems most fitting as the immediate next step, although the narrative is left open-ended.\n\nC"
