Direct contact with the aorta beneath.\n\n-Progressive, suspicious lymph nodes around the aorta, but no clear distant metastases.\n\n-External MR for liver showed no liver metastases.\n\nMedical History:\n\n-ERCP/Stenting for bile duct blockage in 09/2021.\n\n-4 cycles of FOLFIRINOX neoadjuvant from November to December 15, 2021.\n\n-Encountered complications resulting in prolonged hospital stay.\n\n-Received 3 Covid-19 vaccinations, last one in May 2021 and recovered from the virus on August 14, 2021.\n\n-Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.\n\nPhysical stats: 65 kg (143 lbs), 176 cm (5\\'9\\\"). CT consensus:\n\n-Primary tumor has reduced in size with decreased contact with the aorta. New tumor extension towards the celiac trunk. No distant metastases found.\n\n-MR showed no liver metastases.\n\n-Tumor marker Ca19-9 levels: 525 U/mL (previously 575 U/mL in September and 380 U/mL in November).\n\nRecommendation:\n\nExploratory surgery and potential pancreatic head resection.\n\nProcedure:\n\nWe discussed with the patient about undergoing an exploration with a possible Whipple's procedure. The patient is scheduled to meet the doctor today for lab work (Hemoglobin and white blood cell count). A prescription for pantoprazole was provided.\n\nPrehabilitation Recommendations:\n\n-Individualized strength training and aerobic exercises.\n\n-Lung function improvement exercises using Triflow, three times a day.\n\n-Consider psycho-oncological support through primary care.\n\n-Nutritional guidance, potential high-protein and calorie-dense diet, supplemental nutrition through a port, and intake of creon and pantoprazole.\n\nThe patient is scheduled for outpatient preoperative preparation on January 13, 2022, at 10:00 AM.

The surgery involved a detailed abdominal exploration which did not reveal any liver metastases or peritoneal cancer spread. However, a hard nodule was found away from the head of the pancreas in the peripheral mesenteric root, from which a biopsy was taken. Results showed adenocarcinoma infiltrates, leading to the surgery's termination. An additional gallbladder removal was performed due to its congested appearance. The surgical procedure concluded with no complications.\n\nThe relevant text does not mention the start date of radiotherapy for Mrs. Done.\n\nHowever, the text mentions that she underwent radiotherapy from July 2021 to September 2021 (09/06/2021) as mentioned in text_1.\n\nTherefore, I will make an educated guess."
