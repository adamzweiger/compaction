Old friends from their time in the Corps:** The story doesn't mention any shared history within the Corps. Their interaction suggests they are not longtime friends.\n*   **B. Argumentative diplomatic colleagues:** The text explicitly describes them arguing and disagreeing, with Georges frequently challenging Retief's actions and viewpoints. They're working together on this mission, but their interactions are tense and confrontational.\n*   **C. Amicable bridge between Boyar and Corps:** While Retief represents the Corps and Georges is the Chef d'Regime (representative of the Boyars), their relationship isn't portrayed as amicable or focused on bridging the gap. Their bickering highlights a tension, not a harmony.\n*   **D. Brotherly from their Boyar childhood together:** There's no mention of a childhood connection between them.\n\nBased on their argumentative dynamic and working relationship, the most accurate description is that they are argumentative diplomatic colleagues.\n\nB"

They are newly engaged in violent conflict:** While tensions are high and a \"shooting war\" is threatened, it's not a *new* conflict. The text describes a history of disputes.\n*   **C. They are ruled by similar systems of governance:** The text contrasts them\u2014the Boyars seem settled and established, while the Aga Kagans are portrayed as expansionist and opportunistic. The descriptions suggest different governance styles.\n*   **D. They have never before been at war:** This is false. The text describes past attempts at cooperation, as well as the Corps\u2019 intervention in earlier disagreements.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that they have a history of conflict and disagreement, though not necessarily constant war.\n\nB"

He is an Aga Kagan commoner:** The text doesn't present any indication that Stanley started as a commoner. He holds a position of power and authority.\n*   **D. He was born an exalted ruler:** The text refers to him as \"Aga Kaga\" which implies he holds the position of a ruler. He is also spoken about with a great deal of deference.

The Boyars see this as opportunistic and unfair.\n*   **Emotional Response:** The Boyar Chef d'Regime expresses anger and frustration towards the Aga Kagans, wanting to \"clobber\" them and being deeply upset by their actions.\n*   **Their Actions:** They are hesitant to resist because they fear retaliation and the Aga Kagans\u2019 power.\n\nConsidering these points, the most accurate answer is that they view them as invading opportunists.\n\nB"

In fact, they are portrayed as passive and reluctant to intervene.\n*   **Bureaucratic:** The story emphasizes the Corps' adherence to procedures, paperwork (\"Note,\" \"reports\"), and vague policies (\"matters of broad policy\"). The Under-Secretary prioritizes bureaucratic processes over direct action. This strongly suggests a bureaucratic approach.\n*   **Efficient:** The constant reporting, lengthy discussions, and ultimately ineffective response demonstrate a *lack* of efficiency.\n\nTherefore, bureaucratic is the most fitting descriptor.\n\nC"

He also frames the situation as the Boyars eventually being forced to accept his terms.\n*   **Boyars' reaction:** The Boyars are described as \"naive\" and likely to resist if left undefended, and Georges expresses his willingness to fight.\n\nConsidering these points, the most logical consequence of the Corps' inaction is a war between the Boyars and the Aga Kagans.\n\nD"

It infects organisms on the planet with a virus that changes their DNA to make them more suitable for human consumption:** There is no mention of viruses or genetic manipulation in the text.

It can only work on land that has previously contained life:** The text explicitly states they\u2019re transforming \"a wasteland\" and \u201cbare rock\u201d, which implies it works on barren land.\n*   **D. It follows ecological processes to slowly transform barren land into arable land over time:** The text details clearing jungle, descumming seas, irrigating deserts, and setting out forests - all processes that align with ecological transformation over time. It also highlights the 60 year timeframe.\n\nTherefore, option D accurately reflects the described terraforming process.\n\nD"

This is also true.\n*   **C. He does not believe that diplomacy is effective:** While cynical and often sarcastic, Retief actively engages in diplomatic efforts, even if he finds them frustrating. He delivers a Note and tries to negotiate. This statement suggests he believes diplomacy is useless, which isn't fully supported by the text.\n*   **D. He is familiar with the Aga Kagan's custom of speaking in proverbs:** Retief frequently responds to the Aga Kagan using proverbs himself, demonstrating his knowledge of this cultural custom.
