Koroby is getting married to Yasak. The story mentions that she's preparing for her wedding, and there's a lot of focus on her longing for someone else, Robert, who comes from space. \n\nIn the story, Koroby is supposed to be married to Yasak, but she's infatuated with this stranger, Robert. Yasak is practical and doesn't seem to be as emotionally involved. When Robert arrives, he's cold and doesn't show any affection. Koroby falls in love with him, even though she's married to Yasak. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA. They meet for the first time on their marriage date. That's probably not right because they've been together before, as she's getting married to him. \n\nB. Yasak is devoted to her needs. The story shows Yasak is practical but not necessarily devoted. He's more concerned with the wedding and the litter, not her feelings. \n\nC. Koroby is devoted to Yasak but falls in love with Robert. This seems correct. She's married to Yasak but loves Robert. \n\nD. She loves Yasak but he treats her poorly. The story doesn't say Yasak treats her poorly; he's more indifferent. \n\nSo the answer is C.\n</think>\n\nC"

      "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The question is about what Koroby thought of the wedding vehicle she took. The options are A, B, C, or D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the story. The vehicle was part of the wedding procession. The text mentions that the litter was not new, built especially for the occasion. Yasak was practical and didn't want waste, so it was the same old litter she had watched since childhood. When she got into it, she patted the padding and thought it was soft and fragrant, but then realized it smelled stale, hinting of other brides before.\n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA. Carved and painted delicately \u2013 The story says the litter was a canopied framework of gaudily-painted carvings. So that's part of it, but the question is about her opinion. \n\nB. Old and musty \u2013 The text says it was the same old litter, and when she got in, it smelled stale, which suggests it was old and maybe musty. \n\nC. Smelled beautifully of flower garlands \u2013 The flowers were in the litter, but the smell was described as stale, not beautiful. \n\nD. Delightful for space ship \u2013 The vehicle was a litter, not a spaceship. The space ship was the metal globe from the sky, which was later found. \n\nSo the correct answer is B. The vehicle was old and musty because of the stale smell. The story says \"it smelled stale, hinting of other occupants, other brides being borne to other weddings.\" So B is correct.\n</think>\n\nB"

A fairytale of the Stone Age, C. A society on the edge of an industrial revolution, D. A magical Iron Age.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the story. The story is set on Venus, described as having a dusty, red sky, twisted trees, and a society that's somewhat primitive. The main character, Koroby, is getting married, and there's a strange alien figure from space. The Venusians have some technology, like a litter for weddings, but it's not advanced. The alien comes from another world, Terra, which is referred to as a place beyond the sky. The story has elements of fantasy, like the alien being a robot-like figure, and the society seems to be more like a primitive or medieval society with some technological elements.\n\nLooking at the options, the Stone Age (B) is a prehistoric time, but the story has some elements of technology. The Iron Age (D) is a period with more advanced metalworking, but the Venusians have a lot of primitive structures. The Space Age (A) is about space exploration, which the alien comes from, but the Venusian society isn't advanced. The industrial revolution (C) is about technological progress, but the Venusians seem more like a simpler society. However, the story has a mix of primitive and some technological elements. The alien is from a different world, which might relate to the Space Age. But the Venusian society is more like a primitive one, so maybe B or D. However, the Iron Age is more about metal, and the Venusians have metal things like the litter. But the story also has a magical element with the alien being a robot. The answer might be B, a fairytale of the Stone Age, since the setting is more like a primitive, almost mythical world. Alternatively, the Iron Age (D) is more about metal, but the story's Venus is more like a fairytale. The answer is B.\n</think>\n\nB"

      "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what likely happened to Koroby after the story ended. The options are A to D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the ending of the story. From the text, after Koroby sets the fire, the city is on fire. She runs back, and the fire spreads. Then, the people gather, and Yasak finds Robert's remains. The story ends with the fire and the aftermath.\n\nIn the story, Koroby is married to Yasak, but she's in love with Robert. After Robert leaves and she sets the fire, she's probably in trouble. The fire is a big event. The story ends with the city burning, and Yasak is there. The options are about what happened to Koroby.\n\nOption A says she married Yasak. But in the story, she was supposed to be married, but she's in love with Robert. However, after the fire, maybe she's still married. But the story ends with the fire, and maybe she's alive. But the fire might have killed her. Wait, she was injured earlier, and then she set the fire. The fire might have burned her. But the story doesn't explicitly say she died. However, the fire is huge, and she was running back. But the answer options need to be based on the story's end.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she was banished (D) because Yasak was angry. But in the end, Yasak is there, and he's trying to find Robert. The story ends with the fire and the aftermath. The last part says that the people are amazed at Robert's remains, and it's a robot. So Koroby's actions led to the fire, which might have resulted in her being punished. But the story doesn't explicitly say she died. However, the options are about what's likely. \n\nLooking at the choices again. The story ends with the fire, and Koroby is in the city. The fire is huge. The answer might be B, that she died from her wounds in the fire. But the story says she was running back, and the fire spread. However, the story doesn't explicitly say she died. Alternatively, maybe she survived but was banished. But the story ends with the fire, and the people are reacting to Robert's death. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she was married to Yasak (A), but she was in love with Robert. However, the story ends with her setting the fire, which might have led to her being punished. But the answer options are based on the story's ending. The story ends with the fire, and the city is on fire. The story doesn't explicitly say she died, but the fire could have been fatal. However, the options are about what's likely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she was banished (D). But in the story, Yasak is there, and he's trying to find Robert. The story ends with the fire, and Koroby is in the city. The answer might be A, that she married Yasak, but she was supposed to be married. However, the story ends with the fire, and she might have been alive. But the options are tricky. \n\nWait, the story ends with Koroby being in the city, and the fire. The answer options are based on the story's ending. The story says that after the fire, the people are shocked, and Yasak is there. The story doesn't say she died, but maybe she was banished. However, the correct answer is probably A, that she married Yasak, because she was supposed to be married. But she was in love with Robert. However, the story ends with her being in the city, and the fire. The answer might be B, that she died from the fire. But the story doesn't explicitly say that. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is D, that Yasak banished her. But the story ends with Yasak being there, and the fire. The answer is probably A, that she married Yasak, because she was supposed to be married. But the story ends with her being in the city, and the fire. However, the story ends with the fire, and she might have been alive. But the options are based on what's likely. The story ends with the fire, and the city is burning. So maybe she died in the fire. But the story doesn't say that. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is A. Because she was married to Yasak, and the story ends with her in the city. But she was in love with Robert. However, the story ends with the fire, and the answer options are about what happened after. The correct answer is probably A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the answer is B, that she died. But the story doesn't say that. \n\nWait, the story ends with Koroby running back to the city, and the fire spreading. The story doesn't explicitly say she died. However,"

Yasak is the husband of Koroby. Robert is the stranger from space, an alien-like being. When they meet, Robert is described as tall, with a metallic suit, a helmet, and a strange appearance. \n\nIn the story, after Robert saves Koroby, Yasak is with her in the City. When Robert is in the room with Koroby, Yasak is suspicious. He's speculating about Robert, looking at him closely. Then, when Robert is leaving, Yasak is with Koroby, and he's talking to her about going to the City. \n\nAlso, when Robert is found later, Yasak says he wasn't human but a robot. So, Yasak's reaction to Robert's presence is more like suspicion or being threatened. \n\nLooking at the options, C is \"Threatened by his presence.\" The story mentions Yasak's speculating and the fact that he's concerned about Robert's presence, especially after the fire. Also, when Robert is found, Yasak is surprised he wasn't human. So, Yasak might have felt threatened by Robert's alien appearance and possible threat. \n\nBut wait, when they first meet, Yasak is with Koroby, and Robert is carried to the City. Yasak is in the group that's searching for Robert. He's not immediately hostile, but he's cautious. However, when Robert is found, Yasak is amazed he wasn't human. So maybe Yasak felt threatened because Robert was an alien, and he might have felt that Robert was a danger. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he was just curious. But the story says that Yasak is practical, as mentioned earlier. He's not impressed by Robert's strange appearance. So, the answer is probably C: Threatened by his presence.\n</think>\n\nC"

Robert is from Terra, and he lands on Venus. When he first meets Koroby, he says he can read her mind. Later, when they are in the City, Koroby asks him about his name, and he says he has none. Then, when she asks if he can speak their language, he explains that he reads minds. \n\nIn the part where they are in the Stone City, Koroby is talking to Robert, and he mentions that he can read her mind. Also, when she asks about communication with his people, he says he reads their minds. So, it seems like he communicates through telepathy, reading thoughts. \n\nLooking at the options: C is \"He communicates telepathically\" and D is \"He learns thoughts and language through mind reading.\" The story says he reads her mind, so that's telepathy. But the answer might be D because he's reading thoughts and language. Wait, the question is how he communicates with the Venusians. \n\nIn the story, when Koroby asks if he can speak their language, he says he reads her mind. So he doesn't use a device (B), nor do they share a common language (A). He uses mind reading, which is telepathy. So the answer is either C or D. \n\nBut the exact wording in the story: \"I read your mind. I have a remarkable memory.\" So he's reading her thoughts, which would be telepathy. But the options are C and D. The question is about communication with Venusians. When he's in the City, he says he can't speak their language but reads their minds. So the answer is D: He learns thoughts and language through mind reading. But wait, the options are:\n\nC. He communicates telepathically\n\nD. He learns thoughts and language through mind reading\n\nThe story says he reads her mind, so he can communicate by reading thoughts. So the answer is C or D. The key is whether the communication is telepathic (C) or mind reading (D). The story says he reads her mind, so he's using telepathy. But the answer might be D because he's reading thoughts and language. However, the correct answer is D because he's reading their language through mind reading. Wait, the question is how he communicates with the Venusians. He doesn't speak their language, but he reads their minds. So the answer is D: He learns thoughts and language through mind reading.

He comes in a metal globe, is described as tall, with a metallic garment, helmet, and a lot of strange equipment. He doesn't have a name, and he's from a world called Terra. He's not a Venusian but from another planet. He's not a robot in the traditional sense, but he's an alien. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA. Revered as a god by all Venusians. But in the story, Koroby initially thinks he's a god, but he's not. The Venusians don't really worship him; they're more confused. \n\nB. A Venusian who traveled to outer space and came back changed. No, he's from Terra, not Venus. He's an outsider.\n\nC. Artificially intelligent machine that overtook Terra. The story says he's from Terra, and he's a machine-like being, but it's mentioned that he's a robot made to look like a man. The story ends with him being a robot, not a conqueror. \n\nD. Bionic human that's immortal. The story doesn't mention immortality. He's a machine, but not necessarily bionic. \n\nThe correct answer is C. Because he's a machine made to look like a human, and the story ends with him being a robot. The people in the city realize he's not human but a machine. So option C says he's an artificially intelligent machine that overtook Terra. Wait, but the story says he's from Terra, not that he overtook them.

Koroby is engaged to Yasak, but she's been longing for a stranger from space, Robert. Robert is an alien who comes to Venus. He doesn't have a name and is indifferent to her feelings. She's in love with him, but he's cold and doesn't reciprocate. \n\nIn the end, Robert leaves her, and she's heartbroken. She confronts him, he leaves, and she's angry.

But in the story, she's not fleeing the city. She's in the city, and after Robert leaves, she goes out and starts the fire. So A might not be right.\n\nB. To protect Robert from being pursued. But Robert is leaving, and she's angry. She starts the fire to get back at him, not to protect him. So B seems unlikely.\n\nC. She has had her heart broken and is fueled by rage. This fits. She's in love with Robert, he's cold, she's broken hearted, and she starts the fire out of anger. \n\nD. She doesn't wish to marry Yasak, so must create a diversion.

The options are A to D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the story's key events. The story is about Koroby getting married, but she's longing for a stranger from space. The stranger, Robert, appears during the wedding procession. There's a part where Koroby goes off to follow the green light, which leads her to find the crashed spaceship. Then she meets Robert. Later, Robert is in the Stone City, and Yasak is there. \n\nThe question is about when Yasak first reunites with Koroby. From the text, after Koroby leaves the wedding, she goes off with the bearers to follow the light. They find the spaceship, meet Robert, and then Robert leaves. Later, Koroby is in the City, and Yasak is there. The story mentions that Yasak is in the City when Koroby is brought back. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA. He went looking for her when she was late to their wedding. But in the story, Koroby is already married, so maybe not. Wait, no, the wedding is happening, but she's not late. She leaves the wedding, goes off, and then is found by Yasak later.\n\nB. Some of the wedding procession alerted him to her distress. The bearers might have told Yasak about her being missing. \n\nC. He intercepted the wedding procession in a grassy field. The procession is in the jungle, and they go off to follow the light. \n\nD. He was investigating the source of the green flame when he saw her. The green flame is from the spaceship. When Koroby is with Robert, the green flame is there. But when does Yasak see her? \n\nWait, after Koroby leaves the wedding, she goes with the bearers to follow the light. They find the spaceship, meet Robert, and then Robert leaves. Later, Koroby is in the City, and Yasak is there. The story says that Yasak is in the City when Koroby is brought back. So when does Yasak first meet her again? \n\nIn the part where Koroby is in the City, after the fire, Yasak finds her. But the question is about the first reunion. \n\nLooking back, when Koroby is with Robert, she is in the City. But the story says that after the fire, Yasak is there. So maybe Yasak first reunites with her when he finds her after she's been taken away by Robert. \n\nBut the options don't mention that. Let me check the story again. \n\nIn the story, after Koroby leaves the wedding, she goes off with the bearers. The bearers are with her, but they go off to follow the light. Then they find the spaceship. Then Robert is there. Then Koroby is with Robert, and later, Robert leaves. Then Koroby is in the City, and Yasak is there. \n\nThe story says that after the fire, Yasak is in the City and finds Koroby. But the question is about the first reunion. \n\nLooking at the options again. The correct answer is probably D. Because when Koroby is with Robert, the green flame is there. Yasak is in the City, and when he goes to investigate the green flame, he sees her. Wait, but in the story, when Koroby is with Robert, the green flame is from the spaceship. Then, after the fire, Yasak is there. \n\nAlternatively, when Koroby is in the City, Yasak is there. But the first time they meet again is when Yasak is in the City and finds her. But the options don't have that. \n\nWait, the story says that after Koroby is found by the bearers, they take her back. Then she's in the City. But the first time Yasak meets her is when he's in the City and she's there. But the options are about when he first reunites with her. \n\nLooking back, the answer is D. Because when Koroby is with Robert, the green flame is there. Yasak is in the City, and he investigates the source of the green flame, which leads him to find her. But in the story, when Koroby is with Robert, she's in the City. Wait, no. The green flame is from the spaceship. When Koroby is with Robert, they are in the jungle. Then, after the fire, Yasak is in the City. \n\nHmm, maybe the answer is D. Because when the green flame is seen, Yasak is investigating it and sees Koroby. But in the story, the green flame is from the spaceship. The story says that after Koroby is with Robert, the fire happens, and then Yasak is in the City. \n\nWait, the story says that after Koroby is with Robert, she is"

Robert is an alien from Terra who crash-lands on Venus. He's described as being very practical and focused on his mission. When he meets Koroby, he's indifferent to her feelings and more concerned with his own situation.\n\nIn the story, after the crash, Robert says he's stranded and that he's supposed to attend the Reisezek Convention in two weeks.

It's when the author hints at something that will happen later in the story. So, the correct answer should be a part of the story where something is mentioned or implied that later events are connected to it.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Yasak is practical and won't buy a new litter, so he won't buy expensive dresses. But in the story, the litter is old and reused, but Koroby's dresses aren't mentioned as being expensive. Maybe this is a possible foreshadowing, but I'm not sure if it's directly connected.\n\nB. Koroby wishes for a man from the sky, and then an outsider lands. The story starts with her praying for a god from the sky, and then the stranger from space arrives. That seems like a direct example of foreshadowing because her wish is fulfilled by the arrival of the alien.\n\nC. Koroby feels like a bird in a nest on the litter, then she flies away. But in the story, she doesn't actually fly away. She's on a litter, and later she's in a fire, not flying. So maybe this isn't foreshadowing.\n\nD. Koroby feels like she's floating on the litter, then later floats in space. But the story ends with her setting a fire and the alien being a robot, not her floating in space. So this might not be accurate.\n\nSo, option B seems to be the best example.

There's a mention of a metal globe from space, and a stranger named Robert. \n\nIn the text, when Koroby is being carried in the litter, the litter is described as old and not new, which Yasak is practical about. Also, there are servants (litter bearers) who are part of the wedding. The litter bearers are mentioned as being part of the wedding party, which suggests they are servants or lower class. \n\nYasak is the one who is supposed to marry Koroby. The story mentions that Yasak is practical and doesn't want to waste money on a new litter. Also, when Koroby is in the Stone City, there's a slave mentioned, which indicates that Yasak might have some wealth to have slaves. \n\nAdditionally, when Koroby is in the City, she's in Yasak's house, which is described as having fine furniture and coverlets. The presence of a slave (the woman with blue circles on her cheeks) suggests that Yasak has servants, which points to him being a wealthy person. \n\nThe options: C says he's a powerful man who can afford servants. That seems to fit. The other options don't fit as well. A says he's an outcast, but there's no indication of that. B says he's a poor peasant, but the litter and the house suggest he's not. D says he's from a rich family but spent recklessly, but the text doesn't mention him spending money foolishly. The litter being old but still used shows he's practical, not reckless. So C is the best answer.\n</think>\n\nC"

      "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which option is NOT a reason why Koroby is impressed by the stranger from the spaceship.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the story. Koroby is a Venusian girl getting married, but she's yearning for something more. When the stranger lands, she's initially excited. The stranger is described as very tall, with a metallic suit, a helmet, and strange gadgets. He doesn't speak at first, just stares at her. Then he explains he's from Terra. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. His gun looks deadly. Wait, in the story, the stranger has a belt with various objects, including a notched L-shaped thing, but there's no mention of a gun. He doesn't carry a sword or dagger, and the story says he's not carrying a sword. So maybe A is not a reason he impressed her. \n\nB. His spaceship is made of metal. The story mentions the spaceship is a metal globe, and on Venus, they might not have metal buildings. So that's a reason she's impressed.\n\nC. His armor is sophisticated. He's wearing a metallic garment, which is different from Venusian tunics, so that's a reason.\n\nD. He's more good-looking than Yasak. The story says he's very tall and has a finely-chiseled face, so she thinks he's more attractive than Yasak. So D is a reason.\n\nSo the answer is A, because there's no mention of a gun. The stranger's belt has strange objects, but not a gun. So A is not a reason she's impressed.\n</think>\n\nA"

      "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking why the stranger lands on Venus. The options are A through D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the story. The stranger is described as coming from a planet called Terra, which is mentioned as \"a world known as Terra.\" He arrives on Venus in a metal globe that's crashed. He's called Robert, and he's not from Venus. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA. To enlighten the people of Venus by showing them advanced technology. The story doesn't really show him trying to enlighten them. He's more of an observer, but maybe not. \n\nB. To take Koroby back to his planet. But in the story, he says he's not going to take her back. He mentions that Terra is incredibly far away. So B seems incorrect.\n\nC. To observe the people of Venus and send his observations back home. The stranger seems to be an outsider, and he's there because he's from Terra. He's probably there for some mission, maybe to observe or send data. The story mentions he's supposed to attend a convention called Reisezek, which might be a gathering for his people. So he might be there to observe or report back.\n\nD. He lands there by mistake. The story says he's from a world beyond the sky, and his ship was wrecked. He's stranded, so maybe he didn't intend to land there. But the question is about why he landed. The crash was accidental, but the reason for landing might be because of the crash. However, the story doesn't mention a mistake, but rather a crash. \n\nWait, the story says he's \"stranded on Venus, my ship utterly wrecked, and I'm due at the Reisezek Convention in two weeks.\" So he's there because his ship crashed, and he's trying to get to the convention. So maybe he's there to observe or send messages. But the answer options don't mention that. \n\nLooking back at the options, C says he's there to observe and send observations. The story does mention that he's from a different planet and is there for a convention, but the reason he's there is because his ship crashed. However, the question is why he landed on Venus. The crash was an accident, but the reason he's there is because of the crash. However, the answer options don't have that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he's there to observe. The story doesn't explicitly say he's there to observe, but he does seem to be an outsider. The answer C might be correct. \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be D, but the story doesn't say he landed by mistake. He's from another planet, and his ship crashed. So maybe he's there by accident. But the story says he's stranded, so maybe it's a mistake. But the answer options don't have that. \n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is C. The story mentions that he's from Terra and is there for a convention, but he's stranded. However, the question is why he landed on Venus. The crash was an accident, but the reason he's there is because of the crash. However, the answer options don't have that. \n\nWait, the answer options are A, B, C, D. The correct answer is C. Because he's there to observe and send observations back. The story says he's from Terra, and he's there because his ship crashed. But the reason he's there is to send messages. He mentions he needs to communicate with his people. So maybe he's there to observe and send data. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is D, but the story doesn't say he landed by mistake. He's from another planet, and his ship crashed. So the answer is C. Because he's there to observe and send observations back. The story says he's there to attend a convention, but he's stranded. However, the question is why he landed on Venus. The answer is C.\n</think>\n\nC"

Robert is this stranger from space, right? He comes down from the sky, and there's this romantic tension between him and Koroby. But Robert's character seems a bit detached. \n\nIn the story, when Koroby confronts him about his lack of a name, he says that his race doesn't use names and that they're concerned with more important things. He also mentions that he's stranded on Venus and needs to get back to his planet for a convention. He doesn't seem to care much about Koroby's feelings. \n\nWhen Koroby expresses her love for him, he responds coldly, saying he doesn't know what love is. He's more focused on his mission and his own affairs. He even refuses to acknowledge her feelings and leaves her after their argument. \n\nAlso, when she tries to follow him, he doesn't even notice her, and she ends up setting fire to the prairie, which leads to his death. He doesn't show any emotional response to her actions. \n\nSo, looking at the options, C says he views her as an inferior being and feels only apathy. That seems to fit because he's indifferent, doesn't care about her feelings, and treats her more as a person from a lower race. He doesn't see her as a mate (D) but rather as someone he can disregard. \n\nOption A says he sees her as an obstacle, but that's not exactly it. He's more focused on his own mission. Option B is about protection, which isn't the case. So the answer is C.\n</think>\n\nC"

He comes from a planet called Terra. He's got that armor and a helmet. He doesn't have a name, and when Koroby asks, he says he doesn't have one. Then he explains that his race gave up names long ago because they focus on more important things. Also, he mentions that he's stranded on Venus and needs to get to a convention. \n\nLater, when Koroby is in the City, she's with Yasak, and she's in love with Robert. She even has a dream about him. But Robert is cold and says he doesn't feel love because there's no love on his planet. He says it's a waste of time. Then when she confesses her love, he says he doesn't know what love is. \n\nIn the end, she tries to kill him, but he's actually a robot, a machine. The story reveals that he's not human. The final part shows that he's a robot made to look like a man, which explains why he doesn't have emotions. So, the reason he rejects her is because he's a robot without feelings. \n\nLooking at the options, option C says he doesn't have emotions because he's a robot. That matches the story's conclusion. The other options don't fit. He isn't in love with someone else (A), he's not married (B), and he doesn't think her love is sudden (D), but the real reason is his nature as a robot.

The options are Electricity, Glassmaking, Creating fire, or Metallurgy.\n\nLooking back at the story, there's a mention of a metal globe that's crashed down on Venus. The characters are using a litter made of gaudily-painted carvings, which suggests some level of metal work. Also, there's a reference to a metal skeleton later, which implies they have some metallurgy. \n\nThe story also mentions that the stranger comes from Terra (Earth) and has a metallic garment. The Venusians have a litter that's described as a canopied framework of gaudily-painted carvings, which might be made of metal. \n\nCreating fire is mentioned when Koroby is in the litter, and there's a description of a green fire from the crashed object. So they can create fire. \n\nGlassmaking isn't directly mentioned, but the story talks about colored glass for the lights of the litter. So they might have glassmaking. \n\nElectricity isn't mentioned at all. The story doesn't talk about electrical devices or systems. The stranger uses a device that seems to produce light without heat, which might be related to electricity, but the Venusians don't have any mention of electricity. \n\nSo the answer is probably A.

The story is set on Venus, and Koroby is a Venus girl. The text mentions that on Venus, the heavens are roofed by a perpetual ceiling of dust-clouds. So, there's no clear sky or stars visible. The story also says that Koroby's world has no sign of clear sky and stars. \n\nLooking at the options, option A says she can't see space or stars because clouds cover the sky. That aligns with the description in the story. The other options: B says she's a robot, but the story clearly states she's a Venus girl, not a robot. C says everyone is blind, but that's not mentioned. D says she's too young, but the story doesn't mention her age. \n\nSo the answer should be A.

The story ends with Robert, the alien, being found as a metal skeleton with machinery. The people in the city are amazed because he wasn't human. Yasak says he was a toy made to look like a man, implying he was a robot. The story mentions that Robert was a robot created by humans, designed to look like a man but wasn't actually human. So the humans on Earth didn't subjugate robots; instead, the robots were made by humans. The story doesn't say humans left for other planets or evolved into cyborgs. The key point is that Robert was a robot, so the answer is B: Robots have subjugated them. Wait, no, the story says the robots were made by humans to look like men, but they were not humans. The humans didn't subjugate robots; the robots were made by humans. The answer might be B, but the story says the robots were made to look like humans, so maybe the answer is B.
