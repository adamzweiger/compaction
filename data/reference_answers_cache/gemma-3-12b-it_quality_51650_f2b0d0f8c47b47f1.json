He was thirsty:** While he did order a martini, it wasn't the primary reason for leaving.\n*   **B. He was no good at playing craps:** He was doing well at craps, throwing sevens, until he realized it was a \"church\" and felt awkward.\n*   **C. He was embarrassed:** This is the key reason. He was challenged to throw sevens, did so, and then realized he was in a church where gambling was inappropriate, causing him embarrassment.\n*   **D. He was not religious:** The passage doesn't indicate anything about his religious beliefs, just that he was uncomfortable with gambling in a church setting.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nC"

The passage reveals that these \"relics\" are fabricated and sold to tourists. Matheny knows the ring is not genuinely ancient and shouldn't be bought, especially as part of a transaction that exploits a false narrative.\n\nTherefore, Matheny feels guilty because the ring is a fake artifact that should not be sold.\n\n\n\nD"

They are successful cons, but Matheny feels they need a bigger operation to earn enough money to solve their economic woes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD"

Such as you.\" This strongly suggests she was attracted to him because of his Martian origin, which she considered exotic.\n*   **B. He was a college professor:** This isn't presented as a reason for her interest.\n*   **C. He had a large expense account:** While Matheny mentions his expense account, it's not presented as the reason she's interested.\n*   **D. He fought bushcats barehanded in a canal:** Matheny explicitly denies this, stating, \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals.\"\n\nTherefore, the primary reason for her interest is his exotic status.\n\nA"

While Matheny felt self-conscious about his clothes, it's described as a glancing embarrassment, not the *hardest* part.\nC. The officials yelling didn't seem to particularly bother him, it was just a minor annoyance during passport control.\nD. The passage explicitly states that the \"air weighed like a ton of wool\" and \"had apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean,\" causing him to gasp. This indicates a significant breathing difficulty.\n\nTherefore, the hardest part was the difficulty breathing due to the denser atmosphere.\n\nD"

This implies that they wanted to target Earthlings, not restrict them.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the options:\n\nA. Gambling was not allowed on Mars - The passage doesn't mention this. Martian laws allowed gambling.\nB. Martians were not able to run a sweepstakes for Earthlings - This aligns with the text.\nC. Earthlings were not allowed to gamble while on Mars - The passage doesn\u2019t mention this.\nD. Martians were not allowed to gamble while on Earth - This isn't the core issue; Earth's laws affected what Martians could *offer* Earthlings.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nB"

He felt out of place:** The text explicitly states Matheny was uncomfortable in the Church of Choice, feeling it was bizarre and not a place he belonged. This aligns with him not caring about the winnings.\n*   **B. He was a rich man:** The text doesn't mention him being rich, only that he comes from a poor planet trying to survive.\n*   **C. He wanted Doran to have the chips:** There's no indication he intended to give the chips to Doran.\n*   **D. He didn't want to win money from a church:** While he's clearly uncomfortable with the church setting, the text doesn't suggest he inherently disapproves of winning money there. His discomfort stems more from being out of place than a moral objection.\n\nTherefore, his feeling out of place is the primary reason he didn't value the chips.\n\nA"

She went to dinner with him instead of Sastro:** Peri was initially supposed to have a date with Sastro. Gus suggested she break the date so he could con Matheny instead. This creates the opportunity.\n*   **C. She wore a wispy robe:** This is a detail about her appearance, but it doesn't directly contribute to the con.\n*   **D. She got him drunk in the bar:** The story mentions Matheny drinking beer and akvavit with Gus, but it doesn't state that Peri was present or that they got him drunk specifically to facilitate the con.\n\nThe crucial element is Peri breaking the date with Sastro, as this allowed Gus to interact with Matheny and begin the con.\n\nB"
