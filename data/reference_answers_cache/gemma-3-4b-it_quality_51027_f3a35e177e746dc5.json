It mentions the *Elsinore*, a Moon-ferry, and references issues with lobbyists and regulations regarding who is allowed to travel to space. The passage repeatedly uses the term \u201cjaywalker\u201d in connection with individuals who illegally gain passage onto spaceships, particularly due to falsified validation documents. The story explicitly states that Jack refers to the \"Jaywalker\" as \"a kind of idiot who never realizes that certain glandular conditions are fatal in free fall.\u201d The use of \u201cjaywalker\u201d is a metaphorical reference to someone who disregards rules and regulations, much like a pedestrian crossing a busy street without looking.\n\nD"

She\u2019s yearning for a different life and a sense of adventure.\n2. **The Scheme:** She devises a plan to register for a trip to the moon under Nellie Foster's name, using Nellie's validation. This is a deception designed to get her on the ship without Jack\u2019s knowledge.\n3. **The Goal:** She intends for Jack to be \u201csurprised\u201d by her presence on the trip and to realize she\u2019s taken a significant step to save their marriage.

She felt the attendant was overly observant and critical, specifically noting her lack of validation and questioning her well-being. The passage states, \u201cMiss Eagen made a penciled frown as lovely as her machined smile,\u201d and \u201cMarcia shrank into a small huddle, fumbling with the card until it was crammed shapeless into her purse.\u201d This indicates a sense of discomfort and being judged by the attendant.\n\nNow let\u2019s examine the options:\n\n*   **A. The attendant was emotionless:** While the attendant *appeared* to have a \"machined smile,\" the text doesn't primarily focus on her lack of emotion.\n*   **B. She thought her husband loved the attendant:** The text doesn't suggest any romantic feelings between Jack and the attendant.\n*   **C. The attendant found out her true identity:** While there's a hint of this (the questioning about her health), the primary issue is her deception regarding her validation.\n*   **D. The attendant forced her to take a medical exam:** The text states the attendant *asked* her if she was feeling well and then *suggested* an examination, but didn\u2019t *force* it.\n\nOption D is the closest and most direct answer based on the provided text.\n\nD"

The passage explicitly states she was trying to make him realize he was \u201cfighting\u201d for something he didn\u2019t truly value \u2013 her and their unborn child.\n\nA. She resented that he wanted to leave her and go to space - This aligns perfectly with the narrative.\nB. She thought he was having an affair with a flight attendant - There's no mention of this.\nC.

Take off:** While a launch is inherently risky, the passage doesn't emphasize this as the primary danger.\n*   **C. Landing:** The landing is described as needing precise maneuvers and a risky approach, but freefall is specifically highlighted as the most perilous.\n*   **D. Orbit:** Orbiting presents challenges related to maintaining position and course, but again, freefall is given greater significance in the narrative.\n\nBased on the text, freefall is the most dangerous.\n\nA"

The passage describes a conversation where Marcia tells Jack that \u201cshe watches me when I work.\u201d The following lines elaborate on why she says this: \u201cHe's like the Captain of the Elsinore. He's risking his life for a\u2014a stranger. A jaywalker. Not for me. Not even for his baby.\u201d This clearly indicates that she\u2019s observing his actions and decisions, particularly concerning his risky behavior and the potential consequences for others. This contrasts sharply with the idea that he's solely working for her.\n\nNow let\u2019s consider the options:\n\n*   **A. She is suspicious of his relationship with the flight attendant:** The text doesn't mention any relationship with the flight attendant, so this is incorrect.\n*   **B. She questions his skills, decisions, and abilities:** This aligns perfectly with the passage, as she\u2019s expressing concern about his willingness to take risks for someone else.\n*   **C. She nags him not to leave and to return quickly:** While there's an underlying desire for him to return, the core of the statement is about observing his actions and the potential danger involved.\n*   **D.

She realized she hadn't paid attention to Jack\u2019s detailed explanations about his job (orbital calculations, ship handling, etc.).

So he would not be attracted to the flight attendant \u2013 This is irrelevant to the story.\n*   B. So he wouldn\u2019t fight with her \u2013 The story focuses on the journey to the moon, not marital arguments.\n*   C.

She\u2019s observant and doesn\u2019t hesitate to tell the Captain about Marcia\u2019s pregnancy.\n\n3.  **Marcia\u2019s Action:** Marcia deliberately presents Nellie Foster's validation card, knowing it's fraudulent. She\u2019s essentially using Nellie's status to gain access to the ship.\n\n4.  **Miss Eagen\u2019s Response:** After Marcia reveals she's pregnant, Miss Eagen calmly states, \"You're so right,\" implying a tacit understanding and acceptance of Marcia\u2019s actions.\n\n5.  **Shared Knowledge:** The key insight is that Miss Eagen *doesn\u2019t* seem surprised or shocked by Marcia's deception. Instead, she simply moves on to the logistics of the pregnancy and the Captain\u2019s reaction. This suggests they both knew about the plan and Marcia's deception.\n\nConsidering these points, option D is the most accurate.

The text implies that the physical exam is designed to prevent people with certain conditions (like glandular imbalances) from traveling, which could be fatal in free fall.\n\nBased on these details, it\u2019s clear that the travel to the Moon is not exclusive to government officials or those working on the Moon. It\u2019s subject to a health screening process. It isn\u2019t restricted to family and friends either.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nC"
