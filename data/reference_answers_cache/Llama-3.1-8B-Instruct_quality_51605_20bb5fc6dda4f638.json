Mason Jamieson, was killed in Bangkok, Siam (now Thailand) in 1907.\n2. Mrs. Jamieson and her son Earl moved to Wisconsin.\n3. Earl became a Konv when he was 14 years old, and the text mentions that it had been seven years since Mrs. Jamieson's husband's death when Earl was 9 years old.\n4. Therefore, the time between Earl's 9th birthday and his 14th birthday is 5 years.\n5. Since Earl was 9 when it had been 7 years since his father's death, this means that Earl was 16 years old when his father died, and 21 when they moved to Wisconsin.\n6. So, the time between moving to Wisconsin and Earl becoming a Konv is 7 years.\n\n**C**"

The mother, Mrs. Jamieson, had a deep hatred for the agents who killed her husband and were pursuing Earl, who was a Konv like her.\n2. The story mentions that Mrs. Jamieson had been waiting for Earl to grow up so they could seek revenge together.\n3. The mother wanted Earl to learn about the great ones, including Stinson and her husband, and to prepare for their mission to seek revenge against the agents.\n4. Mrs. Jamieson was planning for them to leave Earth together after Earl finished college, implying that she was willing to go to space with him.\n5. However, the story does not explicitly state that she was afraid to go to space.\n\nConsidering these points, the reason for Mrs. Jamieson not going to space with Earl is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that she might have wanted Earl to have a chance to fully avenge his father's death before leaving Earth. This is hinted at when she says \"He was clever and intelligent. He could kill many Agents.\"\n\nHowever, since none of the options directly address this reason, I'll choose the option that seems most closely related to the mother's character and motivations.\n\n \nD"

He practiced using it with his mother in secret, taking longer jumps, until he became confident in his ability to travel to any part of the Earth he chose.\n3. The story does not mention Earl going to space at the end of high school or during his first year of university.\n4. The story does mention that when Earl finished college, his mother planned to leave Earth with him to go to Alpha Centaurus, but it does not specify that they had already gone to space.\n\nBased on the information provided, it can be inferred that Earl and his mother planned to go to space after Earl finished college, but it is not explicitly stated that they had already gone to space by then.\n\nSince the text does not provide a clear answer to the question, I will make an educated guess based on the information that they planned to leave Earth after Earl finished college.\n\n \nC"

Mrs. Jamieson was concerned that Earl had been involved in a fight in Stockholm, but Earl denied it.\n2. Mrs. Jamieson later found out that a Konv had been killed in Stockholm, and it was a Finnish Konv who had gone insane and committed a crime.\n3. This event occurred two weeks before Earl's disappearance.\n\nConsidering these points, it is likely that Earl's disappearance was related to the events in Stockholm, but it was not directly stated that he went there. However, since Earl had just talked to an Agent in Bangkok and had a list of names, it is possible that he went to Bangkok to gather more information or take revenge.\n\nGiven the options, I will take a guess that Earl went to Bangkok."

She has been raising him to understand and use his powers responsibly, but also to hate the Agents who killed his father. \n\nA is incorrect because understanding the Stinson Effect is not Mrs. Jamieson's main problem. \nC is incorrect because while making ends meet is a challenge, it's not her biggest problem. \nD is incorrect because while her scar is a secret, it's not her biggest problem.\n\nB is the correct answer because Mrs. Jamieson's biggest problem is raising her son Earl alone and ensuring his safety, especially as he grows older and more powerful.\n\nB"
