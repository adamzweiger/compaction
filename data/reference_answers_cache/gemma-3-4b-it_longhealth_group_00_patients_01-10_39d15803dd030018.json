However, the surgical resection revealed that the primary tumor was located in the renal pelvis. The patient\u2019s original diagnosis and the details presented were inaccurate. The information given in the recent medical records indicates: \u201cpT3, pN0 (0/11), M1 (ADR), pn1, L1, V1, high-grade.\u201d\n\nTherefore, the correct TNM classification is pT3, pN0, M1, G2.
