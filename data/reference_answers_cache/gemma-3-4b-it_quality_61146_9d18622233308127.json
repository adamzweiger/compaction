Initially, Retief says, \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d when asked his name. This is an incomplete statement.\n2.  Later, he says, \u201cI'm\u2014\u201d again, implying he's not Lemuel's cousin.\n3.  He then states, \"I think I should explain\u2014\"\n4.  He repeats, \u201cI'm\u2014\u201d when questioned about his relationship to Lemuel.\n5.  Finally, he says, \u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d, suggesting he isn\u2019t Lemuel's cousin.\n\nTherefore, Retief tried to state he wasn't Lemuel's cousin four times. However, the multiple choice options do not include four. Let's re-evaluate. He directly stated it three times.\n\nD"

Retief realizes that the Flap-jacks are planning to engage in a fight. He notes that the settlers are not skilled fighters and that he\u2019s better equipped to handle the situation alone. He specifically mentions observing the Flap-jacks\u2019 movements and wanting to be in a position to intercept them. He also mentions a rangerform he\u2019d captured earlier.\n\nConsidering these details, it\u2019s clear he wanted to be in a position to take action without being observed by the farmers.\n\nD"

The Flap-jacks seemed genuinely surprised and impressed by this idea.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C.\n\nC"

What possible significance could one attach to the activities of a couple of random skirmishforms?\"). This suggests he\u2019s not a fan of the idea of fighting.\n\n2.  **Later Comments:** He repeatedly states how much he prefers observing the skirmishes rather than participating himself. He describes the prospect of engaging in combat as causing him \u201csprong-ache\u201d and longing for the \u201ccrowded yellow sands of Jaq\u201d.\n\n3.  **Dismissal of the Past:** He acknowledges that he had hoped to establish a new colony and farm, but now, influenced by Retief, he\u2019s willing to give up the land to the humans.\n\n4.  **Overall Sentiment:** Throughout the conversation, Hoshick consistently expresses a preference for peaceful resolution and an aversion to conflict.\n\nConsidering these points, the best answer is:\n\nD"

He would be missing skin tomorrow... if there was a tomorrow. His thumb found the orifice and probed.\u201d This indicates he exploited a vulnerable area \u2013 the orifice \u2013 to subdue Hoshick. While he initially uses force, the final step in defeating Hoshick is through a targeted maneuver.\n\nConsidering the options:\n\n*   A. He used his power pistol to shoot him - The text doesn\u2019t mention a pistol being used.\n*   B. He fell on top of him and crushed him - This is a possibility, but the passage describes a more deliberate action.\n*   C. He used what he learned from capturing the flap-jack - This is the most accurate description of the final technique; he used knowledge gained from a previous capture to exploit a vulnerability.\n*   D. He twisted his tentacles and injured him - Hoshick is a flap-jack, not a tentacled creature.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C.\n\nC"

To take over the oases - This is correct. He readily agreed to let Retief have them.\nB. To be a farmer - This is a consequence of his desire to have the oases, but not the primary goal.\nC.

To have a plebian contest - He initially preferred this, but ultimately accepted a more civilized arrangement.\n\nA"

The passage repeatedly emphasizes Retief\u2019s adherence to \u201csealed orders\u201d and his bureaucratic nature \u2013 he\u2019s a \u201cred-tape\u201d official. The conversation with Hoshick highlights this, with Hoshick acknowledging Retief\u2019s formal title as \u201cRetief of the Red-Tape Mountain.\u201d The text suggests this title wasn\u2019t arbitrarily assigned but rather a reflection of his profession and personality.\n\nOption A mentions an impulsive creation based on observation, but the text doesn't strongly support this as the *source* of the title. It\u2019s a potential explanation for *how* he came up with it, but not *why* it\u2019s his official name.\n\nOption B describes a history of Retief creating mountains of paperwork, which aligns perfectly with the passage\u2019s description of him. This is a very plausible explanation.\n\nOption C similarly suggests a connection to the red tape, but it feels a little too simplistic and doesn\u2019t capture the specific imagery of \u201cRed-Tape Mountain\u201d as suggested in the passage.\n\nOption D introduces a completely unrelated backstory about nobility and inherited titles, which is not supported by any evidence in the text.\n\nTherefore, the most logical inference is that Retief\u2019s title reflects his profession and the burdensome paperwork he handles.\n\nB"

He then immediately jumps into action \u2013 he commandeers a skiff, engages in a fight with a settler, and narrowly avoids a missile. He reacts impulsively to the situation on the ground.\n*   **The outcome:** Retief\u2019s actions, while ultimately successful in preventing a war, are clearly outside the scope of the \u201cno improvisation\u201d directive.\n\nConsidering these points:\n\nOption A is incorrect because it attributes Retief's lack of improvisation to a deficiency in his diplomatic skills, which isn't the central issue. The problem is that he didn't *have* the orders to follow.\n\nOption B is the most accurate. The text states he didn't receive the orders until he reached Adobe and was already in action.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the text indicates that Headquarters personnel *never* visited Adobe; therefore, they couldn\u2019t have provided expertise.\n\nOption D is partially correct \u2013 Retief is impulsive.
