It's genetic:** While the article acknowledges genetic factors like hybrid vigor, it explicitly states that environmental factors are more significant and that race cannot be directly correlated with athletic ability due to uncontrollable environmental differences.\n*   **B. There are more healthy people to choose from:** The article repeatedly emphasizes the improvements in health care, nutrition, and the decline of infant mortality, leading to a larger pool of healthy individuals from which athletes are drawn. This is a central argument.\n*   **C. There is a racial correlation:** The article explicitly refutes this, stating it's impossible to test and that environmental factors likely account for observed differences.\n*   **D. People have easier lives now:** While improved living conditions contribute to better health, the article focuses more specifically on the impact of healthcare and nutrition on creating a larger, healthier pool of potential athletes.\n\nTherefore, the strongest answer is that there are more healthy people to choose from.\n\nB"

Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from.\u201d This illustrates how better overall health due to medical care creates a larger pool of potential athletes.\n\nTherefore, improved medical care affects athletic ability both directly and indirectly.\n\n\n\nD"

That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it\u2019s a function of how much more competitive other nations have become.\"\n\nThis directly indicates that the decline in British medals is due to increased competition from other countries.\n\nNow let's look at the answer choices:\nA. Due to the effects of World War I - The text doesn't mention WWI as a direct cause.\nB. Due to the post-colonial era - While mentioned, the passage states it's *related* to increased competition, not the sole reason.\nC. Due to other countries being better able to compete now - This aligns directly with the text.\nD.
