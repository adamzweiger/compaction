To be able to practice poor hygiene:** The text explicitly states Manet wanted to \"live more like an animal and think more like a god than any man for generations,\" which includes indulging in undesirable habits like poor hygiene.\n*   **B. To see how long it would take to go mad:** This is a central theme of the story. Manet meticulously planned his isolation to observe his descent into madness.\n*   **C. To compare peace and war:** The story mentions Manet wanting to assess the qualities of peace and decide if it was better than war, demonstrating a desire for philosophical contemplation.\n*   **D. To feel bored:** The text repeatedly emphasizes Manet's boredom and the tedium of his solitary existence as a driving force behind his initial desire for isolation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\nC"

He simply \u201cserves the wants of the spaceman.\u201d  The crucial detail is that he operates on a \u201cTrader Tom Credit Card\u201d which allows customers to buy without ever paying.  Because the purchases are essentially free, there\u2019s no incentive to return items.  The idea of needing to return something is completely foreign to his operation.\n\nConsidering the options:\n\n*   **A. He charges a lot for his wares:** This is incorrect because he offers goods for free.\n*   **B. His merchandise is so pleasing:** This is irrelevant to the reason for no returns. Even desirable items wouldn\u2019t trigger a return request if there\u2019s no cost involved.\n*   **C. People don\u2019t know how much the items cost:** This is incorrect as the passage states they are essentially free.\n*   **D. He only visits each place one time:** This is the most logical reason. Since he's a one-time visitor and doesn\u2019t offer any form of payment or guarantee, there's no reason for customers to return anything.\n\nD\n\nD"

He created Victor as a way to avoid that loneliness and to have someone to challenge him. However, Victor quickly becomes an unbearable antagonist, constantly reminding Manet of his own uselessness and lack of progress. Manet recognizes this and ultimately decides that having Victor as an enemy is preferable to having a passive, unchanging existence. He states, \"With you for an enemy, I don't need a friend!\" This indicates a sense of satisfaction in having a persistent, stimulating challenge, rather than a comfortable companionship.\n\nD"

He found a strange sort of amusement in Veronica's naivete and willingness to be manipulated, even enjoying the dynamic of her being a foil to his intellect.

He actively avoids forming connections, viewing friendship as a hindrance to his self-imposed observation of solitude.

He shows particular irritation with Ronald\u2019s cheerfulness and simplicity.

However, the key piece of information is that his initial contract was for 18.2 years. The text also mentions that an estimate was changed to 31 years and later to 274 years. Since the question asks for *how long* he's been there, and the text focuses on the revised estimates, the most accurate answer is the original estimate of 18.2 years.

Tom responds with evasive answers and philosophical justifications \u2013 essentially, he's a convenient provider rather than a true companion.\n5. **Manet\u2019s Perspective:** Manet repeatedly describes Tom as \"reactionary\" and a \"businessman,\" suggesting a fundamental disagreement on how things should be done.\n\nConsidering these points, the relationship is transactional and superficial.

He wants to study the effects of isolation on the human psyche.\n*   **The Reality of the Job:** The text explicitly states he was hired because the Assembly didn\u2019t want well-integrated people \u2013 they wanted men who would isolate themselves. He\u2019s essentially a glorified watchman, with no real purpose beyond observing.\n*   **Financial Considerations:** While the salary is good (two hundred thousand a year), it\u2019s not enough to overcome the overwhelming desire for solitude and the inherent boredom of the job. The whiskey and the \u201ctailfirst landing\u201d hallucination suggest a deeper dissatisfaction.\n*   **Social Isolation:** The story emphasizes his profound loneliness and inability to form meaningful connections. He actively avoids companionship, even attempting to create an enemy in Victor.\n*   **Colonization Plans:** The text doesn't mention any desire to be among the first colonists. His focus is entirely on his personal experiment.\n\nConsidering these points, the most accurate reason for Manet\u2019s prolonged stay is that he *cannot possibly return to his life on Earth*. He has become deeply entrenched in his solitary existence and finds no compelling reason to leave.\n\nB"
