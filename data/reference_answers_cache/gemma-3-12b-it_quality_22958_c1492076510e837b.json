He knows how to defuse bombs:** The story makes it clear that Braun doesn't know anything about bombs.\n* **D.

The resolution isn't that they're elsewhere, but that he's no longer actively in a situation where he fears for them.\n*   **B. He gave Mr. Harris the wrong answer, but it didn't matter.** The story explicitly states Braun's answer was correct and crucial to the situation. This is incorrect.\n*   **C. He realizes he is not in trouble.** The text indicates Braun initially feared potential repercussions for his involvement and the potential consequences of his guess. The final exchange with Harris assures him he is not in trouble.\n*   **D. Working with the CIA makes him feel that he is doing something respectable.** Braun's whole motivation for appearing respectable is revealed as a fa\u00e7ade to assuage his conscience. Working with the CIA doesn't resolve this internal conflict; instead, he seems to acknowledge the irony of his situation.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting reason for his sigh is that he realizes he's no longer in a tense, potentially dangerous situation and isn't facing repercussions.\n\nC"

He is too old and lost his hunches:** The text states his hunches have worked for sixty years. This contradicts this option.\n*   **B. The stakes are too high because his family is at risk:** The text explicitly states, \"If I guess wrong\u2014\" (and then he thinks) \"Then we're all dead ducks. But why should you guess wrong? My wife and my kids are in the city.\" This makes this gamble different because his personal safety and that of his family are directly threatened.\n*   **C. He doesn't have enough information:** While information is always helpful, the text highlights Braun's skill as a gambler \u2013 one who can make a decision with limited information.\n*   **D. He doesn't like to gamble in a time crunch:** The text doesn't present this as a reason; the pressure comes from the stakes involved.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nB"

This suggests the CIA is tracking him due to his history and personality, which involve skirting legal boundaries.\n\nTherefore, the CIA is interested in Braun's career because he's a professional gambler who operates in a grey area between legal and illegal activities and tries to appear respectable.\n\nD"

The CIA does more than just defuse bombs.\n2. **Consider the remaining options:** Option A is incorrect because the text *does* explain what the CIA is, albeit indirectly.\n3. **Analyze option B and C:** The text describes the CIA as \"Civilian Intelligence Associates\" and refers to its role in handling a national security situation (the \"egg\" in the harbor). This aligns with the idea of a civilian organization keeping the country safe.

He gets to be valuable and respectable doing what he loves:** The passage emphasizes Braun's desire for respectability and how he's attempted to achieve it through various means. His \"hunches\" being valuable, despite his previous attempts at respectability failing, appears to allow him to be valuable and, arguably, respectable while doing something he\u2019s good at, resolving a conflict that Joan had observed in him.
