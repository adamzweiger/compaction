They seem to view the pink anglers as a resource or a form of entertainment, akin to raising animals for sport.\n2. **The Marco's departure:** The Marco leaving doesn't fundamentally disrupt the established order. The squid's culture and practices are unlikely to change drastically due to the brief presence of the Earth vessel.\n3. **War with the anglers:** A war seems improbable. The squid are clearly in control and the anglers are presented as passive.\n4. **Taking a squid aboard:** The story implies that the squid are firmly rooted to Arz. It is improbable they would willingly board the Marco.\n5. **Changing association:** There's no reason to believe the squid would suddenly stop using the anglers.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable assumption is that the squid simply returned to their established routines once the Marco left.\n\n\n\nA"

They are the color of beetle bait:** The text describes them as \"pinkish,\" which has no connection to beetle bait.\n*   **C. They are used to lure larger prey:** This is explicitly stated in the final lines of the story: \"those poor devils are put out there deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse!\"\n*   **D. They appear lifeless:** While their blank faces are mentioned, this doesn't inherently suggest they resemble bait.\n\nThe clearest and most direct explanation from the text is that they are deliberately placed to lure larger prey.\n\nC"

They are described as \"policing\" the islands and owning the pink anglers. The pink anglers are intentionally placed on the islet to be hunted by flying lizards, and then the squid capture them. This strongly suggests that the squid are raising and using the pink anglers as a food source or for some kind of spectacle.\n\nNow let's look at the options:\n\nA. The pink anglers revered the squid - The text doesn't mention any reverence.\nB. The squid collected pink anglers - This is closest to the description of the squid capturing the pink anglers.\nC. The pink anglers tamed the squid - Clearly not the case.\nD. The squid farmed pink anglers - This is the most accurate and best-supported option based on the way the pink anglers are presented as being raised and used.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D.\n\nD"

The anglers\u2019 fate seems to be part of a ritualistic \"sport.\"\n\n*   **C. The anglers were not the squid's primary interest:** The narrative suggests the dragons are the main target of the squid\u2019s hunting. The anglers are merely a consequence, or perhaps a necessary part of the hunt. This aligns with the story's details.\n\n*   **D. The squid were a nearly defeated colony that didn\u2019t have enough members to save every angler:** The story doesn't suggest the squid are a weakened colony.

However, he also acts impulsively, ignoring regulations to investigate the island, which could be seen as reckless.\n*   **Stubborn and talkative:** He argues with Stryker and Gibson, demonstrating a degree of stubbornness, and he does converse frequently.\n*   **Calculated and cautious:** The story portrays him as more impulsive than calculating or cautious.

They also wanted to determine if the planet was suitable for colonization.\n*   **What they learned:** They discovered that the fishers were essentially livestock, used for entertainment by a much more advanced octopus-like species. This revelation explained the fishers' lack of swimming ability and their seemingly suicidal behavior. They also learned the planet was not suitable for colonization.\n*   **Did they achieve their goals?** They *did* unravel the mystery of the fishers\u2019 behavior. However, the revelation and the potential implications (a more advanced species dominating a less advanced one) left many unanswered questions about the octopods\u2019 culture, motivations, and the history of the planet. Additionally, the situation prevents colonization. There was no fun interaction, as they mainly observed from a distance and Farrell was nearly used as bait.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A.\n\nA"

However, he also demonstrates curiosity and a willingness to take action, which are valuable on an expedition.\n*   **C. Stryker:** Stryker is portrayed as a bit grumpy and dismissive (\"Stryker threw up his hands\"), but he's the experienced captain and prioritizes following regulations, which suggests a cautious and responsible leadership style.\n*   **D. Gibson:** The text directly mentions Gibson being a \"know-it-all\" and \u201cstubborn\u201d and \"irritating,\" particularly concerning his insistence on the phantom city.

The story has a central mystery (the city, the fishers' behavior, Farrell's paralysis) and several well-placed reveals that build suspense. The ending, in particular, offers a surprising explanation.\n*   **C. A science fiction fan who really likes interspecies communication.** Interspecies communication is a very minor element. The story focuses more on observation and the disturbing aspects of a dominant alien species' culture than on attempts to communicate.\n*   **D. A fantasy fan because winged lizards are a major element of Arz.** While winged lizards are present, they are more of a plot device than a central fantasy element.

Discovery is fun and can be done without inherently endangering one's wellbeing.** The story demonstrates discovery is *not* without risk - Farrell is captured and nearly paralyzed. So this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C. Communication with other species and cultures is a delicate process that needs to be done with care.** This is the strongest moral of the story. The crew initially disregards cultural sensitivity and almost interferes with a complex, alien ecosystem. Farrell's naivete leads to him nearly becoming a pawn in the squids' 'sport.' The story highlights the importance of caution and understanding before intervening in another culture, even if it seems bizarre or cruel.\n\n*   **D. Learning is a process that takes time and can be best done independently.** While Gibson's persistence eventually pays off, the story doesn\u2019t primarily focus on individual learning or independent study.

This isn't the primary purpose.\n\n* **B. Farrell would've tried to ask him questions about the fishermen in the morning had Stryker been awake.** The text suggests Farrell was frustrated with Stryker's focus on the lost city, but there's no explicit indication that Farrell would have interrogated him about the fishermen had he been awake. This is possible, but not the strongest reason.\n\n* **C. Taking the pill prevented Stryker from helping Farrell.** This aligns directly with the narrative. The text reveals that Stryker unknowingly gave Farrell a pill that paralyzed him, preventing him from calling for help until Gibson arrived. This creates suspense and increases the danger Farrell is in.\n\n* **D. Taking the pill prevented Stryker from helping Marco.** The narrative focuses on Farrell, not Marco, and the pill's effect is solely on Farrell.\n\nTherefore, the narrative purpose was to paralyze Farrell, increasing the tension and setting up the dangerous situation.\n\nC"
