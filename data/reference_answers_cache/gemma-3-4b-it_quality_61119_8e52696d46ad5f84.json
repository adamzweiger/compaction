This suggests McCain is using the machine to eliminate claims that might benefit Madison.\n3. **Madison\u2019s Response:** Madison\u2019s questioning of the machine\u2019s general instructions (\u201cWhat does the nickel-brained machine mean by investigating a whole town?\u201d) reveals a lack of trust in its judgment and a desire for more specific instructions.\n\nConsidering these points, the best answer is:\n\nD. He wanted to continue to be favorited by McCain, but felt his favoritism was at stake because of the Actuarvac.\n\nD"

The primary issue is the unusually high accident rate *caused* by the granite.\n5. **Actuarvac Flaws:** The text hints at the Actuarvac\u2019s limitations and potential for misinterpretation, but doesn't definitively prove it's flawed.\n\nTherefore, the Actuarvac was correct in its suspicion, because the town's high accident rate stemmed from a previously unknown and scientifically explainable cause.\n\nB"
