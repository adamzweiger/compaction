Sell movies to people who don't want to buy them:** The text mentions Pete, an assistant, selling movies to unwilling buyers, but this seems to be his individual job, not the Bureau's overall function.\n*   **B. Manage the campaign for Senator Stokes:** While the Bureau deals with Senator Stokes' concerns, this is a specific incident and not their main function.\n*   **C. Manage the media relating to Grdznth:** The entire latter half of the story revolves around the Bureau's desperate attempts to manage public perception of the Grdznth, crafting PR-blasts, analyzing response data, and addressing the crisis caused by the Grdznth's presence. This aligns directly with public relations activities.\n*   **D. Keep the public from finding out about time travel:** Time travel is mentioned, but it's not the core activity of the Bureau.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nC"

They could show up anywhere at any time:** This is mentioned as a source of annoyance, but the politeness issue is highlighted more strongly.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n\nB"

Their planet was cooling down too much:** The text states their home planet was \"going to get lots hotter any day now.\" This contradicts this option.\n   * **B.

They were being chased:** While there's mention of \"Math boys hot on this,\" this isn't presented as a reason for leaving. It's more of a complication.\n   * **D.

The Earthlings were very hospitable:** The text indicates Earthlings were not initially receptive to the Grdznth, leading to the need for a PR campaign.\n*   **B. It had the right climate for their gestation period:** The text explicitly states that Earth had a climate \"better than at home\" for gestating Grdznth. This aligns directly with their need to have their \"wives\" gestate.\n*   **C. There was a large source of food for them:** The story doesn't mention anything about food resources.\n*   **D. It was nearby in location to their most previous home:** The story implies they were traveling through parallel universes, suggesting distance wasn't the primary factor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nB"

He suggests a different angle.\n*   **The key idea:** Pete proposes focusing on the Grdznth as expectant mothers, tapping into the societal reverence for motherhood.\n*   **The PR Blast:** The plan involves a PR blast emphasizing the Grdznth mothers and their impending births.\n\nTherefore, Pete's strategy centered around emphasizing their status as expecting mothers.\n\nB"

The Grzdnth kept coming through in greater numbers:** The text mentions the increasing number of Grdznth, but it's not the primary cause of Pete's anxiety.\n*   **B. The government was starting to threaten Pete's job:** While the senator threatened Tommy's job, Pete's anxiety stems from something deeper.\n*   **C. The public was only willing to wait 1 more month for the Grzdnth babies:** This is a factor, but not the core of Pete's concern.\n*   **D. Pete hadn't received any progress reports on the technology advancements:** This is the crucial point. Pete's anxiety arises because Charlie Karns hasn't been providing updates and the lack of progress on the technology (specifically the transmatter and null-G) means their entire plan is built on a shaky foundation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nD"

This instability would lead to extreme cold, making Earth unsuitable for them, but devastating to humans.\n*   **The Outcome:** The story concludes with Charlie Karns stating that Earth would become \"a little too cold for Grdznth. They thought Earth was much nicer...For them.\" This implies the Grdznth would leave (unable to survive), and Earth would suffer, without any resolution involving humans. None of the other options are hinted at.\n\nB."

They were afraid of humans:** The text doesn't suggest fear. Their actions are described as stemming from a cultural imperative.\n*   **C. It is part of their culture:** The story explicitly states that their politeness is an inherent characteristic and something people find \"insufferable\" about them. It is a cultural trait that makes it difficult to provoke them.\n*   **D. They need time to pass without causing trouble:** This is a result of their politeness, not the root cause.\n\nC"

They don't seem to view humans as equals or partners, but more as a resource. They are unapologetic about their actions that inconvenience humans.\n*   **Charlie Karns\u2019s Explanation:** They're exploiting Earth\u2019s environment for their own purposes, with little regard for the consequences for humans.

Empathy for the Grdznth:** The PR men *succeeded* in creating empathy for the Grdznth by focusing on their impending motherhood, which temporarily quelled public discontent.\n*   **C.

Aliens are dangerous:** While the Grdznth are initially frightening, the story doesn't portray them as inherently malicious. Their actions stem from a desperate need to survive, and their politeness is even highlighted as a complicating factor. They aren't actively seeking to harm humanity.\n\n*   **B. Public Relations is manipulative:** This is a strong contender. The story heavily critiques the use of public relations to shape public opinion, even when dealing with a potentially disastrous situation. Tommy's desperate attempts to spin the Grdznth's arrival demonstrate how easily PR can be used to mask or downplay serious problems. The shift to emphasizing Grdznth motherhood exemplifies this manipulation.\n\n*   **C. Don't trust someone just because they're polite:** This theme is present, as the Grdznth's politeness initially hides their intentions and contributes to the escalating situation. However, it's more of a supporting element than the central theme.\n\n*   **D. Ugly things are evil:** This is a demonstrably false theme presented by the story and is actively undermined throughout. The Grdznth are described as ugly, but their actions and motivations are not inherently evil.\n\nConsidering these points, the most prominent theme is the critique of public relations and its potential for manipulation.\n\nB"

He calmly speaks to the Grdznth on the rocketjet, confronts the senator, and initiates the plan to use Grdznth motherhood for PR.\n*   **C. Tired:** He does sigh a lot and seems resigned to situations, suggesting weariness, but it's not his defining characteristic.\n*   **D. Confident:** Pete exudes a degree of confidence. He takes charge, offers solutions, and isn't easily intimidated. This aligns well with his role as a PR man.\n\nTherefore, the best descriptor is bold.\n\nB"
