The situation is incredibly dangerous and likely to result in the deaths of everyone aboard.\n2. **Ivy\u2019s Motivation:** Ivy Hendricks, the ship\u2019s new Engineer, recognizes the surge-circuit\u2019s potential and is determined to prove her father\u2019s brilliance and vindicate his reputation (which Gorman unfairly damaged).\n3. **Strike\u2019s Reaction:** Initially, Strike is hesitant and doubts the mission\u2019s feasibility. However, when Ivy collapses from exhaustion, he takes over the controls and successfully executes the maneuver.\n4. **The Unexpected Decision:** Despite the risks and Ivy\u2019s pleas, Strike *chooses* to save Gorman.

Cob is more casual about it, noting the presence of women but without a strong opinion.\n2. **Ivy\u2019s Promotion:** Ivy Hendricks, after saving the ships, is promoted and takes a design position.\n3. **Strike\u2019s Reaction:** Strike\u2019s discomfort is highlighted as he grapples with the idea of a woman outranking him and potentially marrying her. He acknowledges it's a complicated issue.\n4. **Cob\u2019s Observation:** Cob, observing Strike\u2019s struggle, realizes that Strike\u2019s aversion to women of rank is a significant barrier.\n\nBased on this, the story demonstrates a shift in their appreciation of women of rank \u2013 they begin to understand that it's not simply about gender equality but about a deeply ingrained personal discomfort with a woman holding a higher position. \n\nD"

Hendricks, is what the orders say.\u201d And further, \u201cHendricks\u2019 father built the ship and trained her on it.\u201d  The Captain\u2019s initial skepticism is based on not knowing her, and then she reveals she is Harlan Hendricks\u2019 daughter. This immediately establishes a connection and reason for confidence. The Captain also notes, \"She\u2019s old... but she's loose. And we're not likely to meet any Ambassadors or Admirals with her, either.\" This suggests a certain trust based on her familiarity with the ship's design.\n\nNow let's evaluate the answer choices:\n\n*   A. The Captain never gains confidence in Hendricks - This is incorrect, as the text shows a shift from skepticism to trust.\n*   B. The Captain always believed in Hendricks\u2019 abilities due to her excellent reputation - The text doesn\u2019t mention her reputation, it\u2019s the familial link that matters.\n*   C. Hendricks\u2019 father built the ship and trained her on it - This is the most accurate reflection of the text's reasoning.\n*   D. Hendricks had proven her abilities over years working with the Captain - The text doesn't state that she had worked with the Captain before.\n\n**C**"

There\u2019s a significant power dynamic and Ivy is initially cold and distant.\n\n2. **Ivy's Motivation:** Ivy\u2019s primary driving force throughout the story is proving her father\u2019s legacy correct and demonstrating her own competence\u2014especially in relation to Gorman.

It\u2019s a self-contained story.\n2. **Technical Details:** While there are technical mentions (surge-circuit, torpedo tubes, etc.), they\u2019re presented in a relatively accessible way, not as a deep dive into engineering. They serve the plot, not overwhelm the reader.\n3. **Humor:** The passage has moments of lightheartedness and irony (Strike\u2019s awkwardness, Cob\u2019s observations), but it isn\u2019t primarily comedic.\n4. **Ship Descriptions/Voyages:** The descriptions of Venusport and the Aphrodite are sparse and functional. The focus is on the characters and the events, not a detailed depiction of the ship\u2019s operation or a sense of peaceful travel. The voyages themselves are fraught with peril and problems.\n\nConsidering these points, the most accurate description of the author's style is that he uses descriptions of the ship's surroundings to show the peaceful voyages the Aphrodite goes on, as the narrative focuses on the action and the characters\u2019 experiences rather than detailed descriptions of ship operations or the environment.\n\nD"

Strike\u2019s narration is jaundiced, and the description of Venusport is bleak. There's a feeling of resignation and a lack of excitement.\n\n2. **Rising Tension:** As the story progresses, the tension increases. The Ganymede incident, the Procyon A warning, and the Canalopolis brawl all contribute to a building sense of danger and conflict. The focus shifts to the ship\u2019s problematic history.\n\n3. **Climax & Immediate Aftermath:** The rescue of the Lachesis and Atropos is undeniably intense \u2013 the heat, the near-disaster, and Ivy\u2019s sacrifice create a moment of high stakes. Immediately following this, there's a period of somber reflection and mourning.\n\n4. **Resolution & Reflection:** The final paragraphs shift to a more contemplative and slightly bittersweet tone. Cob\u2019s observation about Strike\u2019s new position and the unspoken feelings create a sense of closure, though tinged with a hint of melancholy. The overall atmosphere is less frantic and more measured.\n\nConsidering these shifts, none of the options quite perfectly capture the journey.

A sci-fi fan who likes romance-heavy stories:** While there\u2019s a hint of romance, it\u2019s not the primary focus. The story is heavily weighted towards the technical aspects of spaceship operation and the challenges of the mission.\n\n*   **B. A sci-fi fan who likes suspense and watching friendships grow:** This is a strong contender. The passage builds suspense with the near-disaster, the potential for disaster with the surge-circuit, and the central plotline of Strike\u2019s awkward adjustment to his command and his burgeoning, though ultimately unrequited, friendship with Ivy. The slow development of their relationship is a key element.\n\n*   **C. A fan of fantasy-adventure stories:** This is less likely. The story is firmly rooted in a realistic, somewhat gritty, space setting, not fantasy.\n\n*   **D. A fan of adventure stories where the protagonist has to fit in with a new group:** This also aligns well. Strike\u2019s constant struggles to fit in with the established hierarchy and the crew of the *Aphrodite* is a major theme throughout the passage. His awkwardness and his attempts to manage the ship and its crew are central to the narrative.\n\nConsidering the emphasis on tension, character relationships, and a protagonist navigating a difficult social environment, option B is the most suitable.\n\nB"
