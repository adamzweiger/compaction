He seems practical and perhaps a bit controlling (e.g., the litter being the same old one, his reaction to Koroby\u2019s actions).\n*   **C:** This is the most accurate. Koroby is initially resigned to the marriage and doesn\u2019t express strong feelings for Yasak. She actively falls in love with Robert.\n*   **D:** While Koroby isn\u2019t enthusiastic about Yasak, the text doesn't indicate he treats her poorly.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C.\n\nC"

She likely married Yasak:** The story concludes with Yasak marveling at Robert's remains and protecting Koroby. While he's initially annoyed, the ending suggests a return to the expected societal norms. He seems to have regained control of the situation and is unlikely to abandon the marriage arrangement.\n*   **B. She likely died from her wounds in the fire:** While she was near the fire, the story doesn\u2019t indicate she sustained any injuries. It focuses on the destruction of Robert and the aftermath, not Koroby\u2019s well-being.\n*   **C. She likely hurried to complete her space ship to explore Terra:** There is absolutely nothing in the story to suggest Koroby has any mechanical skills or interest in building a spaceship. This is a complete fabrication.\n*   **D. Yasak was so fed up with her at that point he likely banished her:** While Yasak is initially displeased, the narrative emphasizes a return to order and societal expectations. Banishment seems a harsh and unlikely response, especially given his protective gesture at the story's conclusion.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible outcome is that Koroby will proceed with the marriage to Yasak, despite the unusual events.\n\nA"

This suggests a curious, assessing, and slightly cautious attitude, rather than immediate friendliness.\n*   Yasak orders someone to \"carry these men\" (Robert and Koroby) and then says, \"We're not very far from the path to the City now. Shall I carry the girl?\" This shows he is taking charge and trying to maintain control of the situation.\n*   He glances at Robert \"furtively\" while giving orders. This implies he is wary or potentially threatened by Robert's presence and assessing him.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is that Yasak felt threatened by Robert's presence.\n\nC"

There's no widespread reverence.\n*   **B. He is a Venusian that travelled to outer space and returned home completely changed:** The text explicitly states he is *not* from Venus but from Terra (Earth).\n*   **C. He is an artificially intelligent machine that overtook planet Terra from humans:** The text reveals he's a machine made to look like a man, and it hints that such machines were created on Terra. The text doesn\u2019t mention him taking over anything.\n*   **D.

She starts the fire by accident while fleeing Stone City:** The text explicitly states she deliberately uses a firestone to ignite the grass. This eliminates accident.\n*   **B. She starts the fire to protect Robert from being pursued:** The passage indicates Robert is already attempting to escape and seems unconcerned with being pursued, and Koroby\u2019s actions are fueled by anger at him.\n*   **C. She has had her heart broken and is fueled by rage:** The passage describes Koroby being rejected by Robert, who dismisses her feelings and calls them a \"waste of time.\" She then expresses anger and declares she \"could kill you,\" before ultimately starting the fire. This aligns closely with her actions.\n*   **D. She does not wish to marry Yasak, so must create a diversion:** While she initially expresses discontent with the impending marriage, her actions are directly triggered by Robert's rejection, not her desire to avoid the marriage.\n\nTherefore, the primary motivation appears to be her rage and heartbreak after Robert's dismissive rejection.\n\nC"

This option isn't accurate.\n*   **B. Some of the wedding procession alerted him to her distress:** The litter-carriers who could still speak *after* Koroby's actions alerted Yasak to what had happened and that she was gone. So, he isn't initially alerted to her distress.\n*   **C. He intercepted the wedding procession in a grassy field:** The story does not mention an interception.\n*   **D. He was investigating the source of the green flame when he saw her:** Yasak and a searching party were looking for Koroby *after* she disappeared towards the green flame.

It's an interpretation rather than a foreshadowing element.\n*   **B:** This is the strongest example of foreshadowing. Koroby explicitly states her desire for a man to \"drop out of the skies.\" The subsequent arrival of Robert fits this wish directly, hinting at the unexpected events to come. Foreshadowing involves hints or clues about what will happen later.\n*   **C:** While there's a metaphorical connection (bird in a nest, then flying), it's more symbolic than foreshadowing. It doesn't directly hint at a future event.\n*   **D:** Similar to C, this is more symbolic than predictive. It creates a thematic link but doesn't really foreshadow a concrete event in the narrative.\n\nB"

He's being courted to marry Koroby, a desirable woman.\n* **Eliminate B:** While Yasak is practical and doesn't sanction \"any kind of waste,\" the fact that Koroby is being considered for marriage suggests a certain level of social standing and resources. A poor peasant likely wouldn't be able to engage in such a union.\n* **Consider C:** The text mentions Yasak having servants (litter-bearers and musicians) and being able to order them around, demonstrating authority and the ability to command others. This points to a higher social status. The fact that he can sanction expenditures (even disapproving of waste) also suggests some financial independence.\n* **Eliminate D:** There's no indication that Yasak has recklessly spent a fortune.

He appears to be wearing sophisticated armor:** The text describes him as being in \"metallic garment[s]\" and \"armor,\" and mentions how well made it is, which initially impresses her.\n*   **D.

Metallurgy:** The text mentions \"iron doors\" in Yasak's house and that Yasak is a \"practical man\" who wouldn\u2019t sanction waste, suggesting an understanding and use of metals.\n\nThe most telling point is the detail about the colored glass around the lights, which directly refutes option B.
