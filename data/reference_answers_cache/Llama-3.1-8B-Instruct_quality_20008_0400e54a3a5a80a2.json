It is mentioned as a broader social context in which the Olympics have become more inclusive, but it is not a factor that contributes to the pool of athletes.\n\nThe large population of the earth (A) and the expanding middle class worldwide (D) are related to the pool of good athletes.\n\nThe expanding middle class worldwide (D) is related to the pool of good athletes because it implies that more people have access to better nutrition, health care, and education, which can contribute to better athletic performance.\n\nThe large population of the earth (A) is also related to the pool of good athletes because it increases the number of people from which to draw potential athletes.\n\nC is the correct answer."

The author is discussing how humans have been able to improve their athletic performance over time, despite being considered biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts.\n\nStep 1: The author is suggesting that humans should be subject to the same limitations as automobiles, implying that there should be a cap on human performance.\nStep 2: However, the article explains that humans have been able to improve their performance over time, which contradicts the idea of a fixed set of limitations.\nStep 3: The article attributes this improvement to demographic changes, such as better nutrition, healthcare, and living conditions, which have allowed humans to produce bigger and healthier bodies.\n\nConsidering these points, the correct answer is that humans are not subject to the same limitations as automobiles because they are not fixed machines with a standard set of parts.

It states that this is because there are physical limitations that cannot be broken. The passage does not mention anything about oxygen change, Lasix, or the breeding history of Thoroughbreds.\n\nConsidering the given information, the most plausible reason for the stall in speed gains in Thoroughbreds is related to their physical limitations. This leads us to consider option A.\n\nA. Creating horses that were strong but lightly built ran into trouble at the point when the horses bones were so fragile that a lot of horses started breaking down during races."
