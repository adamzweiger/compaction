When humans from Earth started giving medical care wherever they traveled - This option is partially correct, but it doesn't mention the specific event that led to Earth earning its new title.\n\nB. When Earth became known as unrivaled in its development of the biological sciences - This option mentions the reason why Earth was able to provide medical care, but it doesn't specify when it earned its new title.\n\nC. When humans from Earth became known as Galactic Pill Peddlers - This option mentions the nickname given to the doctors from Earth, but it doesn't specify when Earth earned its new title.\n\nD. When the first contract was signed - This option mentions the event that led to Earth's reputation as a medical authority, which eventually earned it its new title.\n\nThe text states that \"It was a rugged service for a single planet to provide, and it was costly. Many planets studied the terms of Contract and declined, pleasantly but firmly\u2014and were assured nevertheless that GPP ships would answer an emergency call if one was received. There would be a fee, of course, but the call would be answered. And then there were other planets\u2014places such as Morua II...\"\n\nThis suggests that the reputation of Earth as a medical authority, and the title \"Hospital Earth,\" was established after the signing of the first contract.\n\n**D**"

The planet Morua II is a Class VI planet that has previously tried to establish a Contract with Hospital Earth, but was rejected.\n2. The last attempt to establish a Contract resulted in the Earth ship being thrown out bodily, with half the crew being shot and the others returning with their ears cut off.\n3. Despite this, Morua II somehow managed to obtain the Contract Code.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible explanation is that the Contract Code was obtained from a crew member before they were shot or had their ears cut off.\n\n**D**"

The doctor, Sam Jenkins, is trying to cure the patient without having a Bio-survey of the patient's species, which is a common practice in the story.\n\nGiven this context, the doctor's treatment seems to be a general supportive therapy. The options provided are glucose, aspirin solution, viremia drugs, and antibiotic.\n\nConsidering the symptoms of the illness (fever, starvation, and dehydration), the most likely treatment would be something that would help to alleviate these symptoms. Glucose (A) is a simple sugar that can help to replenish energy and provide hydration, which would be beneficial for a patient suffering from starvation and dehydration.\n\nAspirin solution (B) is an antipyretic that can help to reduce fever, but it's not directly related to the other symptoms of starvation and dehydration.\n\nViremia drugs (C) are not explicitly mentioned in the story as a treatment for the Pox, and it's not clear how they would help with the symptoms of starvation and dehydration.\n\nAntibiotic (D) is not directly relevant to the symptoms of the illness described.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most likely option is:\n\nA\n\n**A**"

He also mentioned earlier that he had iron needles and potions that eat the bottoms out of their jars. However, when he administered the substance by feeding tube, he mentioned that the wizard, Kiz, was surprised by the reaction of the purple-colored fluid in the flask, which was churning and boiling. This reaction suggests that the substance was not a simple sugar water or a placebo. Considering the context, it's likely that the substance was an antipyretic, which is often used to reduce fever. The closest option that matches this description is aspirin, which is an antipyretic.\n\nC"

The Earth doctor had already administered an IV drip and medication to the patient through the tube in the patient's mouth.\n2. He had also set up bunsen burners and a gas tank, which suggests that the treatment was already in progress.\n3. The Earth doctor handed the mortar and pestle to the local doctor (Kiz) and instructed him to continue the treatment.\n4. The context implies that the mortar and pestle were used in a specific, crucial part of the treatment.\n\nConsidering these points, the mortar and pestle seem to be used as a form of \"supportive therapy\" or a way to create a specific effect on the patient. The text doesn't explicitly state the purpose of the mortar and pestle, but based on the context, it seems that the Earth doctor used it to help the local doctor understand the treatment.\n\nA.

The Doctors are in a hostile environment with armed guards and are at risk of being harmed if they fail to cure His Eminence.\n2. They are aware that they can't cure His Eminence without a Bio-survey, which they don't have.\n3. They try to negotiate with the Moruans, but it becomes clear that they will be killed if they don't cure His Eminence.\n4. Jenkins makes a deal with Kiz, offering to teach him about modern medicine in exchange for a Contract with Hospital Earth.\n5. Jenkins' plan involves treating His Eminence with a combination of modern medicine and tricking the Moruans into thinking he's using magic.\n\nGiven these points, the highest priority of the Doctors is to convince His Eminence's people to sign a Contract with Hospital Earth, which would ensure their own safety and the success of their mission.\n\n**D**"

This suggests that the Red Doctor specializes in surgery, while the Green Doctor specializes in medicine.\n\nSince surgery is often associated with the circulatory system, and the circulatory system is closely related to the heart, it's reasonable to infer that the Red Doctor specializes in heart-related issues.\n\nThe Green Doctor, on the other hand, is likely associated with the ancient Earthly art of medicine, which might include internal medicine, which often involves the digestive system.\n\nSo, the specialties of the Red and Green Doctors are likely related to the heart and digestive systems, respectively.\n\nC"

It also mentions that the crew of the Lancet had to answer a crash-priority call from Morua II, despite Morua II not having a Contract with Hospital Earth.
