This indicates that Methotrexate was being used for uveitis, not for COVID-19, depression, or rheumatoid arthritis at the time of admission.\n6. The primary reason for initiating Methotrexate upon admission is not directly stated as a new reason, but rather it was previously prescribed for uveitis and was discontinued.\n7. However, the question is about the reason for initiating therapy with Methotrexate upon admission. Since it was discontinued upon admission, it was not initiated at that time.\n\nWait \u2014 re-reading: The text says \"The home medication of Methotrexate and Prednisolone for uveitis was discontinued upon admission.\" This means Methotrexate was being used for uveitis and was stopped.\n\nTherefore, Methotrexate was not initiated upon admission \u2014 it was discontinued.\n\nBut the question asks: \"what was the primary reason for initiating therapy with Methotrexate (Trexall) 25 mg upon admission?\"\n\nSince it was discontinued upon admission, it was not initiated.\n\nHowever, the only diagnosis linked to Methotrexate is uveitis.\n\nThus, the reason for initiating it (if it were initiated) would be for uveitis.\n\nAnswer: C. Uveitis\n\nC"

Elevated s-IL-2 \u2192 TRUE (present)\nB. Normal s-IL-2 \u2192 FALSE (it was elevated)\nC. High \u00df-2-Microglobulin \u2192 FALSE (it was normal)\nD. Normal CRP \u2192 FALSE (it was elevated)\nE. Increased CRP \u2192 TRUE (present)\n\nStep 4: The question asks which was NOT a component. So we look for the FALSE statement.\n\nBoth C and D are false, but C says \"high\" (which is not accurate \u2014 it's normal), and D says \"normal\" (which is false \u2014 it's increased).\n\nBut the key is: \"high \u00df-2-Microglobulin\" \u2014 the value was 3.6 mg/L, which is within normal range (0.8-2.2 mg/L). So it was NOT high.\n\n\"Normal CRP\" is false because CRP was 7.3 mg/L (elevated).\n\nSo both C and D are incorrect, but C is more directly false \u2014 the value was not high.\n\nHowever, the question is: which was NOT a component? So if a value was not present or was false, that's the answer.\n\nBut in the list, \"high \u00df-2-Microglobulin\" is incorrect because it was normal.\n\n\"Normal CRP\" is incorrect because it was elevated.\n\nBut the text says \"elevated s-IL-2\" and \"increased CRP\" are both present.\n\nSo options A, C, D, E are all about what was found.\n\nThe one that is NOT true is C \u2014 high \u00df-2-Microglobulin \u2014 because it was normal.\n\nThus, C is the correct choice as it was not a component (it was false).\n\nE is \"increased CRP\" \u2014 which is true, so it was a component.\n\nTherefore, the one that was NOT a component is C.\n\nC"

Visualized up to the descending part of the duodenum. Unremarkable upper esophageal sphincter. Normal motility and mucosa in the upper, middle, and distal esophagus. The Z-line is sharply demarcated in the hiatus. The cardia closes sufficiently. The stomach expands normally in all parts under air insufflation. Multiple glandular cysts < 8 mm in size in the fundus and corpus. Approximately 1 cm irregular mucosal area at the corpus-antrum junction on the greater curvature side.
