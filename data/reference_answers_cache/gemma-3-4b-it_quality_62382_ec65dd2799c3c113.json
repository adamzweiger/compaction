He uses phrases like \u201ctry to understand,\u201d \u201cdon\u2019t make things worse,\u201d and \u201cDiscipline, for not longer than it takes to clear the rock below.\u201d These suggest he\u2019s trying to de-escalate and control the situation, not express anger. Option A, containing uncontrolled anger, contradicts this careful approach. Option B, maintaining relations with the Hans, is a potential reason, but it doesn't fully explain the Officer\u2019s specific phrasing. Option C, a mistaken identity, introduces a new and unlikely element not supported by the text. Option D, friendship with Kirk\u2019s father, is irrelevant to the immediate situation. The Officer is prioritizing a measured response and avoiding further conflict.\n\nD"

He suspects they are deliberately withholding necessities.\n3. **Randl's Revelation:** Randl, before dying, reveals that the Captain's yellow daughter was seen carrying heat-stones into the Ship.

He discovers the Captain\u2019s daughter is involved in this manipulation.\n\n3. **Randl\u2019s Death & Revelation:** Randl, a Hans, dies revealing this secret to Kirk. This signifies a shift in Kirk's perspective.\n\n4. **The Raid:** The Piruts attack, and the Officers, instead of defending effectively, actively allow the attack to proceed.

They\u2019re *maintaining* control through manipulation and, in this instance, calculated surrender.
