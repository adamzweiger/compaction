While it's presented as though it's levitating or flying, the text ultimately reveals it's a trick using a thread.\n\nNow let's consider the options:\n\n*   **A. It can drive itself.** The text does not suggest it has any self-propulsion.\n*   **B. It levitates in the air.** This aligns with the initial demonstration, although it's a deceptive appearance.\n*   **C. It flies in the air.** Similar to B, this is the perceived effect, but not the reality.\n*   **D. It can detect life in outer space.** There's no mention of this capability.\n\nGiven the illusion created during the demonstration, option B is the most accurate representation of what the gadget *appears* to do.\n\nB"

He wants to buy the gadget for his nephew.** He mentions wanting to give it to the \"boys in the shop\" which are his colleagues, not his nephew.\n*   **D.

This thing is way overpriced and hasn't been moving at all.

It doesn't mention Biff's cash, his opinion of the gadget's value, or profit margins.\n\nC seems to be the closest logical answer as it infers the demonstrator believes Biff would be willing to buy it at a lower price.\n\nD is incorrect, as it doesn't align with the provided reasoning in the text.\n\n\n\nC"

This inconsistency will bother scientifically-minded people.\n3. **The Key:** The older man states the key is that this paradox \"will nag at them\" and cause them to experiment.\n4. **How it Works:** The creators have patented the coils, which means they will profit from any advancements resulting from the others\u2019 research.\n5. **Therefore:** The patents (D) are the loophole that enables the creators to benefit from the work of others.\n\nD"
