      "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about why the author thinks many people involved in the scandal are blamed. The options are A, B, C, D.\n\nThe passage discusses various individuals and their roles. For example, Betty Currie is criticized for not quitting despite knowing about Clinton's affairs. George Stephanopoulos is blamed for not having been critical earlier. The author seems to hold people accountable even if they weren't directly involved in the misconduct but failed to act on their knowledge. \n\nLooking at the options: Option A says they were at fault even if they didn't quit on principle. The passage mentions that Currie didn't quit, but the author still criticizes her. Similarly, Stephanopoulos didn't quit but is blamed for hypocrisy. So A seems possible. \n\nOption B talks about not being loyal, but the author points out that loyalty isn't always good. For example, Stephanopoulos was loyal but betrayed Clinton later, which is criticized. So B might not be right. \n\nOption C is about not alerting media soon enough. The passage doesn't focus on that; it's more about their actions or inactions regarding Clinton's behavior. \n\nOption D says they knew and didn't tell Hillary. The passage mentions Hillary knowing but not taking action. But the focus is more on not acting on their knowledge, not specifically telling Hillary. \n\nSo the correct answer is A. The author blames people even if they didn't quit, because they knew and didn't act, like Currie and Stephanopoulos.\n</think>\n\nA"

The options are A, B, C, or D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the context provided. The article discusses various people involved in the Clinton scandal and their ratings. The author is critical of some figures like Betty Currie and Monica Lewinsky, but also points out that the public's reaction is complex. \n\nLooking at the part about the American People, the text says: \"The American People (The public's rating: +7 ) Minuses: a) Hypocritically claim to despise scandal, follow it breathlessly, then blame the media for obsessing over it. b) Are secretly fascinated by the sleaziness of it. Pluses: a) Magnanimous toward the president.\" \n\nSo the author is pointing out that the public claims to despise the scandal but is actually fascinated by it, which is hypocritical. This suggests that the public did blame themselves in a way, but the author is critical of their hypocrisy. \n\nThe question is whether the public received blame. The answer options need to be checked against this. \n\nOption B says yes because they pretend to despise scandals but couldn't get enough of them. That aligns with the text's point about the public's hypocrisy. The author mentions that the public is \"hypocritically claim to despise scandal, follow it breathlessly...\" which matches option B. \n\nOther options: A talks about calling for impeachment, but the text doesn't mention that the public was blamed for that. C says they aren't accountable because it's between consenting adults, but the text doesn't really address that. D says they were obsessed, hurting innocent people, but the text does mention that the media was criticized, not the public directly. \n\nSo the correct answer is B.\n</think>\n\nB"

The question is asking who the most innocent person involved in the scandal is, with options being Linda Tripp, Hillary, Monica, or Chelsea.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there's a detailed scorecard for various individuals. For example, Monica Lewinsky has a very low rating (-9), described as having seduced a married man, lied, and blabbed her affair. She's criticized a lot. \n\nLinda Tripp is also rated -7, with minuses including betraying her friend and being a tattletale. She's not seen as innocent.\n\nHillary Clinton is rated +2, but her minuses include knowing about Bill's affair and protecting him. However, she's considered somewhat sympathetic because she was lied to and cuckolded. But the question is about innocence.\n\nChelsea Clinton is rated +10, with no minuses listed. The text says she had family problems exposed, was humiliated, and her summer ruined. But she's the only one with no minuses. The passage says she's the most innocent because she didn't participate in the scandal beyond being a victim. The answer is D. Chelsea.\n</think>\n\nD"

The options are Clinton, Hillary, Monica, or the media.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there's a detailed scorecard for various individuals. The main scandal here is the Clinton-Lewinsky affair. The article discusses different people's roles. \n\nBill Clinton's score is -9, and the public's rating is -6. The text mentions that Clinton had an affair, lied, and obstructed justice. The public's rating for Clinton is very negative. \n\nHillary Clinton's score is +2, and the public's rating is +4. She's described as protecting her husband, which might make her a bit of a defender, but the public still gives her a positive rating. \n\nMonica Lewinsky's public rating is -9, and she's criticized for seducing Clinton and lying. However, the article also says she was sexually exploited and had her reputation smeared. \n\nThe media's public rating is -8, but they are criticized for excessive coverage. However, the question is about who the public believes is most responsible. \n\nThe article's title is \"The Flytrap Blame Game,\" and the scorecard shows that Clinton has the most negative rating. The public's rating for Clinton is -6, which is the highest negative. The media is rated -8, but that's more about their coverage. \n\nSo the answer is likely A. Clinton. The public's rating for him is the most negative, and he's directly involved in the scandal.\n</think>\n\nA"

The options are A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the context provided. The article discusses the Flytrap Blame Game, focusing on various individuals involved in the Clinton scandal. Specifically, there's a section about Hillary Clinton's rating. \n\nLooking at the text, under Hillary Clinton's entry, the minuses include: \"Knew what a lech he was, yet always protected him. May have always known truth about Lewinsky, yet still lied to protect Bill. Chose aggressive, political strategy over contrition.\" The pluses are about her being lied to by her husband and being personally humiliated. \n\nSo, the key points here are that Hillary knew about Bill's affair and still protected him, and she lied to protect him. The question is asking why she was faulted. The options are:\n\nA. She did not do enough to protect her daughter from what happened.\nB. She spoke out against her husband, which is not allowed.\nC. They have an open relationship, and she's with a woman.\nD. She stood by him even though she knew he was guilty.\n\nFrom the text, the fault is because she protected him despite knowing, and she lied to protect him. So option D says she stood by him even though she knew. That matches the text's minuses. Option A isn't mentioned; the text says she protected him, not that she didn't do enough. Option B is about speaking out, but the text doesn't mention her speaking out against him. Option C is not discussed in the text. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n</think>\n\nD"

The options are A through D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the context provided. The article discusses various people involved in the Clinton scandal and their ratings. Specifically, there's a section on Monica Lewinsky. Let me check that part again.\n\nLooking at the section for Monica Lewinsky, the minuses include: seducing a married man, damaging the presidency for casual sex, lying frequently, blabbing her \"secret\" affair to lots of people, and protecting herself with immunity when she needed to. The pluses mention that she was sexually exploited by her boss, her reputation was smeared, she was betrayed by Linda Tripp, and she was dragged into the scandal against her will.\n\nThe question is about what the public faults her for. The options are A. Got caught, B. Embarrassed the nation, C. Told too many people about her affair, D. Hurt Chelsea.\n\nFrom the text, the public's rating for Monica is -9. The minuses list her lying, blabbing the affair, and others. The article says she \"blabbed her 'secret' affair to lots of people,\" which is option C. The public likely faults her for that because it's mentioned as a minus. Also, the article states she \"damaged and endangered the presidency for the sake of casual sex\" which might relate to B, but the specific point in the minuses is about telling too many people. The answer is probably C.\n</think>\n\nC"

The question is about why the public despises Linda Tripp. The options are A to D.\n\nLooking back at the context provided, there's a section on Linda Tripp. The text says she betrayed her \"friend,\" which is Monica Lewinsky. Also, it mentions she \"obsessively nosed into the private lives of others\" and tried to score a book deal off sex gossip. Additionally, she's called a tattletale. \n\nThe options are: B says she tried to make a book deal and profit, C says she betrayed her friend, and D says she has a big mouth (which relates to her talking too much). The text lists several minuses for Tripp, including betraying her friend, trying to make a book deal, and being a tattletale. The public's rating is -7. \n\nThe question asks for a big reason. The text explicitly states that she betrayed her friend (option C) and that she tried to make a book deal (option B). However, the answer might be C because the article specifically mentions that she \"betrayed her 'friend'\" as a major minus. Also, the plus point is that she was a whistleblower, but the main reasons for public disdain are the negatives. The answer is likely C. But wait, the text also says she \"tattletale\" and tried to score a book deal. However, the question is about the biggest reason. The article says \"Betrayed her 'friend'\" is a minus, so that's a key point. The answer is C.\n</think>\n\nC"

The correct answer should match one of these points. Option B says he used his time as pastoral counsel for Clinton to gain media attention, which aligns with the second minus point mentioned.

The options given are A to D. \n\nOption B says he defended Clinton, but the text says he spun the denial, which is a minus. The plus is that he was dismayed, which isn't listed as an option. However, the plus includes being loyal. But the question is about the \"plus\" listed. The answer options don't include \"dismayed,\" but option B says he defended Clinton. Wait, but the plus is that he was dismayed, not that he defended. However, the answer options might not have that.

Wait, the plus is that he was dismayed, which is not an option. But the options are A-D. The correct answer according to the text is that his plus is that he was dismayed, but that's not an option. However, the plus includes \"Is quitting the administration (though not, apparently, on principle).\" So maybe D is \"He quit his position.\" But the text says he is quitting, but not on principle. So D is a plus. However, the answer options are:\n\nD. He quit his position.\n\nBut the text says he is quitting, so that's a plus. So the correct answer would be D. But wait, the plus includes that he was dismayed, but that's not an option. Alternatively, the plus is that he was dismayed, but that's not listed. The options given are A, B, C, D. The correct answer according to the text is D. However, the text says he is quitting, which is a plus. So the answer is D. But wait, the question is asking for one of the things that give Mike McCurry a \"plus.\" The plus points are: was clearly dismayed, is quitting (not on principle), and loyal.

The options are A, B, C, or D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the section on George Stephanopoulos in the Scorecard. From the text, under George Stephanopoulos, the minuses are listed as:\n\na) Hypocritical for him to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying dog. After all, he knew that Clinton was a lech in 1992 and helped cover it up. Yet he has never shouldered responsibility for the lies Clinton told then.\n\nb) Disloyal to turn on old boss as viciously as he has in past few weeks.\n\nSo the two minuses are his hypocrisy for discovering Clinton's lies later when he had known earlier, and his disloyalty in turning against Clinton. The question is asking for the biggest \"minus,\" which would be the most significant point against him.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. He tried to say that he had no idea that Clinton was the type of man who would have an affair even though he had been covering for him for years.\n\nWait, the text says he knew Clinton was a lech in 1992 and helped cover it up. So the first minus is about him being hypocritical for not having known earlier and not taking responsibility. But option A says he tried to say he didn't know, which might not be exactly what's stated. The text says he helped cover it up, so he was aware. The first minus is about him not taking responsibility for covering up.\n\nOption B: He begged Clinton to deny everything. The text mentions that Morris encouraged Clinton to deny, but Stephanopoulos is mentioned in the minuses as not having taken responsibility. The text doesn't explicitly say he begged Clinton to deny, but maybe that's part of his role. However, the text says he helped cover up, so maybe that's part of his minuses.\n\nOption C: He stood by Clinton as he always had. That's the opposite of the minuses. The text says he was disloyal in turning against Clinton, so C is a plus, not a minus.\n\nOption D: He did not quit his job. The text says he's a white knight, but the rating is -2. The text mentions he didn't quit on principle, which is part of the minuses. However, the main minus is about his hypocrisy and disloyalty.\n\nLooking back at the text: The first minus is about him being hypocritical for discovering Clinton's lies in 1998 when he had known since 1992. So the main point is that he knew but didn't take responsibility. The answer would be A or B. Wait, the text says \"hypocritical for him to 'discover' in 1998 that Clinton is a lying dog. After all, he knew that Clinton was a lech in 1992 and helped cover it up. Yet he has never shouldered responsibility for the lies Clinton told then.\" So the main minus is that he knew and helped cover it up but didn't take responsibility. Option A says he tried to say he had no idea, but the text says he knew. So maybe the answer is A? Wait, the text says he helped cover it up, so he was aware. The \"minus\" is that he didn't take responsibility. The option A says he tried to say he had no idea, but the text says he knew. So maybe A is not correct. The text says he was hypocritical for not having known earlier. Wait, the text says he \"knew that Clinton was a lech in 1992 and helped cover it up. Yet he has never shouldered responsibility for the lies Clinton told then.\" So the minus is that he knew and helped cover it up but didn't take responsibility. The option A says he tried to say he had no idea, which is not correct. The text says he did know. So the correct minus is the first one, which is option A? Or is it option B? The text says he \"helped cover it up\" and \"has never shouldered responsibility.\" The first minus is about his hypocrisy for not taking responsibility. So the answer would be A, but the text doesn't say he tried to say he had no idea. Wait, the text says \"hypocritical for him to 'discover' in 1998 that Clinton is a lying dog.

For instance, Monica Lewinsky's pluses include being sexually exploited, her reputation smeared, betrayed by Tripp, and dragged into the scandal. So D is a plus for her. But for others, like Betty Currie, her pluses are reputation for honesty and probably dragooned into cover-up. So D (humiliated) might be a minus for some, but in the case of Monica, it's a plus. Wait, no, Monica's pluses include that she was dragged into the scandal against her will, but D says \"Was humiliated\" which is a minus for her, but in the article, it's listed as a plus for her? Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at Monica's pluses: a) Sexually exploited by her older boss. b) Had her reputation smeared by Clintonistas and the media. c) Betrayed by Linda Tripp. d) Dragged into the scandal against her will. So \"Was humiliated\" is part of her pluses? Wait, in the Minuses for Monica, it's listed as d) Dragged into the scandal against her will. But the plus is that she was dragged into the scandal, which is a plus? Wait, no. The Minuses for Monica include \"Dragged into the scandal against her will\" as a minus, but the plus is that she was a whistleblower (see d under Minuses). Wait, the article says: \"Pluses: a) Whistleblower (see d under Minuses): risked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong.\" So \"risked humiliation\" is part of the plus. So D, \"Was humiliated\" would be a minus, but in the case of Monica, it's part of her plus because she risked it. Wait, but the question is about which is NOT a plus. So if D is a plus for some, but not for others, but the question is about which is NOT a plus in the ratings. \n\nLooking at the options again. The question is which is NOT a plus. Let's check each option against the article's pluses.\n\nOption A: \"Deserved compensation but it was not given it.\" I don't see this in any of the pluses. For example, Betty Currie's pluses are reputation for honesty and probably dragooned into cover-up. No mention of compensation. Maybe someone else? Like Paula Jones? Her pluses include being vindicated because Clinton did it. Not compensation. So A might not be a plus.\n\nOption B: \"Did not spread the scandal.\" For example, the Secret Service's plus is that they did not leak. So B is a plus for them. So B is a plus, so not the answer.\n\nOption C: \"Asked Clinton to be open about his wrongdoings.\" For example, George Stephanopoulos urged Clinton to be fully contrite. So C is a plus. So C is a plus, not the answer.\n\nOption D: \"Was humiliated.\" For Monica, being humiliated is part of her pluses (as she was dragged into the scandal against her will, and she risked humiliation). But for others, like Bill Clinton, his pluses include that his private life was exposed. But for some, being humiliated is a minus. However, in the case of Monica, it's a plus. But the question is which is NOT a plus. So if D is a plus for some, but not for others, but the question is about which is NOT a plus in the ratings. Wait, the question is about which is NOT a plus listed in the ratings. So if D is a plus for some, but not for others, but the question is asking which is NOT a plus. However, the options are about which is not a plus. So the answer is A, because none of the pluses in the article mention \"deserved compensation but it was not given it.\" For example, in the case of Paula Jones, she was vindicated, but not necessarily that she deserved compensation. So A is not a plus listed. Therefore, the answer is A.\n</think>\n\nA"

The user is asking to compare and contrast the overall assessments of Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the sections for Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton in the scorecard. \n\nFor Hillary Clinton, the public's rating is +4. The minuses include knowing about Bill's actions and protecting him, while the pluses mention being lied to and cuckolded. The Slate rating is +2, suggesting some sympathy but also acknowledging her complicity.\n\nChelsea Clinton's public rating is +10. The minuses are none, and the pluses include being humiliated and having family issues, but she's treated with a lot of sympathy. The Slate rating is +10, indicating she's seen as more innocent.\n\nSo, Hillary had some complicity, while Chelsea was more harmed but not complicit. The assessments give Chelsea more sympathy because she wasn't involved in the actions, whereas Hillary was partly responsible. The answer should be B, where both have some sympathy but Chelsea is more deserving because Hillary was complicit.\n</think>\n\nB. Both of them were viewed with some sympathy, but Chelsea was deemed more deserving of sympathy because Hillary was somewhat complicit."

The question is asking which of the given orderings from most reprehensible to least reprehensible according to Slate's ratings.\n\nFirst, I need to check the ratings for each of the individuals mentioned in the options. Let me recall the Slate ratings from the provided text.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- Bob Barr (R-Ga.) has a public rating of -5, and his Slate rating is 0. Wait, no, the text says: \"Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga. (The public's rating: -5 ) ... Slate rating: 0\". So his Slate rating is 0.\n\n- James Carville's public rating is -1, and his Slate rating is -5.\n\n- Lanny Davis has a public rating of -1, and his Slate rating is -3.\n\n- Erskine Bowles has a public rating of \"Doesn't care\", but his Slate rating is +4.\n\nWait, the options are about the order from most reprehensible (lowest rating) to least (highest rating). So the most reprehensible would have the lowest Slate rating (most negative), and least reprehensible would have the highest (most positive).\n\nSo let's check each person's Slate rating:\n\nBob Barr: 0 (from the text: \"Slate rating: 0\")\n\nJames Carville: -5 (Slate rating: -5)\n\nLanny Davis: -3 (Slate rating: -3)\n\nErskine Bowles: +4 (Slate rating: +4)\n\nSo the order from most reprehensible (lowest rating) to least would be:\n\nJames Carville (-5) > Lanny Davis (-3) > Bob Barr (0) > Erskine Bowles (+4)\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nOption A: Bob Barr (-5?), no, Bob Barr's Slate rating is 0. Wait, the text says for Bob Barr: \"Slate rating: 0\". So the options are:\n\nA. Bob Barr (0), James Carville (-5), Lanny Davis (-3), Erskine Bowles (+4). Wait, but that would be in order from most to least. But James Carville has a lower (more negative) rating than Bob Barr. So the correct order should be James Carville (-5) first, then Lanny Davis (-3), then Bob Barr (0), then Erskine Bowles (+4). That would be option B: James Carville, Lanny Davis, Bob Barr, Erskine Bowles. But looking at the options:\n\nOption B is James Carville, Lanny Davis, Bob Barr, Erskine Bowles. That matches the order of -5, -3, 0, +4. So that's correct. \n\nBut wait, the options given are:\n\nA. Bob Barr, James Carville, Lanny Davis, Erskine Bowles\n\nB. James Carville, Lanny Davis, Bob Barr, Erskine Bowles\n\nC. Lanny Davis, Bob Barr, James Carville, Erskine Bowles\n\nD. Bob Barr, Erskine Bowles, James Carville, Lanny Davis\n\nSo the correct order is James Carville (-5) first, then Lanny Davis (-3), then Bob Barr (0), then Erskine Bowles (+4). That's option B. So the answer should be B.\n</think>\n\nB"

The options are A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the ratings given in the text. Let me check the relevant sections.\n\nLooking at the Scorecard section:\n\n- Hillary Clinton's rating is +2. The public's rating is +4, but the Slate rating is +2. So she's considered somewhat sympathetic but not entirely innocent.\n\n- David Kendall's rating is -1. He's a lawyer who relied on legal arguments to help Clinton, but his rating is negative.\n\n- The Clinton Cabinet has a Slate rating of +3. They were conscripted into defending Clinton but didn't quit, so they have a positive rating.\n\n- The Secret Service has a Slate rating of +5. They were dragged into the scandal but testified honestly and didn't leak info. Their rating is positive.\n\nSo, the order from least to most reprehensible would be the ones with the highest (least negative) to lowest (most negative) ratings.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C: Secret Service (+5), Hillary Clinton (+2), The Clinton Cabinet (+3), David Kendall (-1). Wait, but +5 is highest, then Hillary at +2, then Cabinet at +3? That doesn't make sense because +3 is higher than +2. Wait, maybe I got the order wrong. Wait, the question is from least reprehensible (most positive rating) to most (most negative). So the order should be from highest (least bad) to lowest (most bad).\n\nSo the highest ratings are:\n\nSecret Service: +5\n\nThen Hillary Clinton: +2\n\nThen The Clinton Cabinet: +3\n\nThen David Kendall: -1\n\nBut that would be Secret Service, Hillary, Cabinet, David. But that's not one of the options. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA. Hillary, David, Cabinet, Secret Service \u2192 No, because Secret Service is +5, which is higher than others.\n\nB. Secret Service, Cabinet, Hillary, David \u2192 Secret Service (+5), Cabinet (+3), Hillary (+2), David (-1). That would be correct if the order is from least to most. But wait, the Cabinet is +3, which is higher than Hillary's +2. So that would be Secret Service (+5), Cabinet (+3), Hillary (+2), David (-1). But that's not one of the options. Wait, looking at the options again.\n\nOption C is Secret Service, Hillary, Cabinet, David. That would be +5, +2, +3, -1. But that's not correct because +3 is higher than +2. So the correct order should be Secret Service, Cabinet, Hillary, David. But that's not an option. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the ratings.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nSecret Service: +5\n\nClinton Cabinet: +3\n\nHillary Clinton: +2\n\nDavid Kendall: -1\n\nSo the correct order from least to most reprehensible (i.e., highest to lowest rating) is Secret Service (+5), Clinton Cabinet (+3), Hillary Clinton (+2), David Kendall (-1). But that's not one of the options. Wait, the options given are:\n\nA. Hillary, David, Cabinet, Secret Service \u2192 No.\n\nB. Secret Service, Cabinet, Hillary, David \u2192 Yes, that's the order. But the options don't have B as the correct one. Wait, the options are:\n\nLooking back:\n\nOption B: Secret Service, The Clinton Cabinet, Hillary Clinton, David Kendall \u2192 That would be +5, +3, +2, -1. Which is correct.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the correct order from least reprehensible (most positive rating) to most (most negative). So the correct order is Secret Service (highest), then Cabinet (+3), then Hillary (+2), then David (-1). So option B is correct. But let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA. Hillary Clinton, David Kendall, The Clinton Cabinet, Secret Service \u2192 No, because Secret Service is the highest.\n\nB. Secret Service, The Clinton Cabinet, Hillary Clinton, David Kendall \u2192 Yes, this matches the order.\n\nC. Secret Service, Hillary Clinton, The Clinton Cabinet, David Kendall \u2192 This would be +5, +2, +3, -1. But the Cabinet is +3 which is higher than Hillary's +2, so that's wrong.\n\nD.
