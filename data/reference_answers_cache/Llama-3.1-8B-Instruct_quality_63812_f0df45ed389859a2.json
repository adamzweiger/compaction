Mrs. Perkins mentions that she has 10 children, and she is being sent to a home for old ladies on Earth because her children have grown old and stodgy and don't want her around anymore.\n2. There is no mention of her grandchildren visiting her or her spending time with them during the story.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it is reasonable to conclude that Mrs. Perkins did not spend time with any of her grandchildren during the story.\n\n**C**"

However, two of those encounters are not face-to-face meetings with Darling. \n\nConsidering the question asks how many times Mrs. Perkins runs into Darling, I'll exclude the two encounters where she is in a space suit and pretending to be Darling.\n\nSo, Mrs. Perkins runs into Darling twice in face-to-face meetings.\n\n**D**"

The pirates were initially planning to kidnap Darling, not the other way around, so option B is also unlikely.\n3. There is no mention of the pirates working on film sets with Darling, so option C is also unlikely.\n4. The pirates were planning to kidnap Darling for ransom, which suggests that they had some prior connection to her, but the text doesn't specify what that connection is.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most logical conclusion is that there was a prior connection between the pirates and Darling, which led to the pirates planning to kidnap her for ransom.\n\n**D**"

When she entered the private lounge reserved for first-class passengers, the Captain was initially annoyed by her presence.\n5. He tried to get rid of her, but she continued to interact with him and the other passengers.\n\nGiven these points, it's clear that the Captain did not have a close or endearing relationship with Mrs. Perkins.

When Grandma Perkins mentions her grandniece Agatha, Darling responds by preening, indicating she is vain and self-conscious about her appearance.\n3. Darling is described as having a \"scarlet\" mouth, which she is sensitive about, showing she can be a bit self-conscious and possibly even a bit rude.\n4.

She is shown to be clever and resourceful, as she tricks the pirates into thinking she is Darling Toujours and helps them into the ship.\n3. She is not depicted as kind or reserved, but rather as a bit manipulative and cunning.\n4. She is described as \"frail\" and \"withered\", but also as being able to move with \"serene calmness\" and able to handle a heavy box, suggesting that she is not as fragile as she appears.\n5.
