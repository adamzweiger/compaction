Pop is more concerned about the practicalities and risks. So, this isn't the primary difference.\n*   **B:** While Pop *does* express concern about leaving Earth, Bobby's main focus is the excitement of space travel, not worry about the future.\n*   **C:** This accurately reflects the difference. Bobby initially envisions the journey as a thrilling adventure, fueled by science fiction stories. Pop approaches it with a more grounded, serious perspective about establishing a settlement and fulfilling a long-held dream.\n*   **D:** The text suggests Bobby is still a \"kid\" who needs to be told to behave, indicating he's not particularly mature.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C.\n\nC"

Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my dream on all of you. The world we have known and loved lies behind us. Before us lies only uncertainty...'\"\n\nThis clearly indicates Pop was concerned about imposing his dream on his family and felt a sense of guilt about potentially disrupting their lives and familiar world. He questioned whether it was fair to them.\n\nNow let's look at the options:\n\n*   **A.** This aligns perfectly with the quoted text about feeling it might not be fair to the family.\n*   **B.** There's no indication that Pop believes the mission will fail.\n*   **C.** The text doesn't state that the family was forced to leave, but rather that Pop is considering if it's fair to make them come.\n*   **D.** He expresses uncertainty, but he isn't explicitly stating it\u2019s not a good decision, only that it\u2019s a significant change with potential downsides.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A.\n\nA"

Bobby makes too many errors...:** The passage doesn't state Bobby makes errors, but rather that he wishes Pop stood straighter and that Dick can \"do anything, everything at once.\" This hints at Dick being more capable, but not necessarily because of Bobby\u2019s mistakes.\n*   **B. Dick is more mature and takes the journey seriously...:** The text describes Bobby as \"not a kid\" but also mentions Dick telling Bobby to \"shut up\" and reminding him that he has to \"obey orders\" like a sailor. Dick's demeanor is shown as more serious and professional.\n*   **C. Bobby does not cooperate with Pop as well as Dick does:** The text doesn\u2019t specifically mention cooperation, but Dick's overall role as First Mate and his immediate actions (handling the ship, assigning tasks) suggest a better working relationship with Pop.\n*   **D. Dick is more physically fit than Bobby:** While Dick is described as sturdy and strong, the passage does not imply physical fitness is the primary reason for Pop\u2019s preference.\n\nBased on the passage, Dick's maturity, competence, and seemingly better working relationship with Pop point to him being favored for spaceship duties.\n\nB"

They were unsure that they would have the necessary resources to survive the first few days on Eros.** The passage states they had \"meager belongings\" and need to \"start crops\" which implies they are aware they won't immediately have everything they need.\n*   **D.

This eliminates A.\n*   **Option B:** The text describes the planetoid as having an atmosphere, water, vegetable life, and a river with fertile valleys. This suggests the potential for survival, contradicting B.\n*   **Option C:** The text emphasizes that the planetoid's resources are *not* identical to Earth's. This aligns with the observations of different animal species.\n*   **Option D:** The text mentions \"usable food sources,\" such as the green rabbit-like creature and vegetable life, but acknowledges they are not exactly like Earth's. This fits the description.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate assessment is that Eros has resources, but they are not identical to Earth's.\n\nD"

They're pursuing a land grant and a new life.\n*   **B. A family moving to a developed country for work:** While there's an element of seeking opportunity, Eros is not a developed country. It's an uninhabited planetoid they intend to settle.\n*   **C. Moving across the city to a new house:** This is far too trivial compared to interstellar travel and establishing a colony on another planet.\n*   **D. Settlers traveling to uninhabited land:** This aligns perfectly. The Moseleys are essentially pioneers, traveling to a relatively untouched planetoid to establish a settlement and build a new life. It mirrors the historical experience of settlers moving to new frontiers.\n\nD"

A degree of frustration with leaving Earth:** The text mentions Pop contemplating if forcing the move on his family was \"fair,\" and Martha expresses annoyance (\"Of course I want to go on. No, never mind that!\"). This suggests some frustration or reluctance, but it isn't the dominant feeling.\n*   **B. Uncontainable excitement:** While Bobby expresses excitement, the adults appear more reserved and thoughtful. The journey seems daunting, and the initial excitement has faded into routine.\n*   **C. Regret for leaving Earth:** Similar to frustration, there's a hint of regret, especially with Pop's questioning whether the move was right for his family. However, it\u2019s not overpowering.\n*   **D. A degree of uncertainty:** The text repeatedly highlights the unknown nature of Eros, the difficulties they might face, and Pop's questioning of the move. This creates a palpable atmosphere of uncertainty about their future. Pop's statement \"Before us lies only uncertainty\" explicitly confirms this.\n\nTherefore, the most pervasive feeling is uncertainty about the challenges and outcomes of settling on a new planet.\n\nD"

      "generated_text": "Let's analyze the text to determine the best answer.\n\n*   **A. The family would be largely unaffected because supplies were temporary, and they needed to quickly find more sustainable resources regardless.** The text indicates the supplies were important (\"Some tools, guns, wire\u2014stuff like that\"). While finding sustainable resources was always a goal, losing supplies would still impact the ease and speed of establishing themselves.\n\n*   **B. The family would no longer have felt uncertain about their future if they had all their supplies from the spaceship.** The text shows that Pop was already expressing uncertainty about leaving Earth (\"I'm not sure this is fair to you and the children\"). The crash and loss of supplies exacerbates this, but it wasn't the sole source of his concern.\n\n*   **C. The family would have been more confident in their survival if they had not lost so much supplies.** This aligns directly with the narrative. Dick expresses frustration about the loss, and the need to salvage what they can. Having intact supplies would undeniably boost their confidence.\n\n*   **D. The family knew they would successfully survive with or without their supplies from the spaceship.** The text portrays the situation as precarious, highlighting the reliance on supplies to begin with. There's no indication they were inherently certain of success regardless.\n\nTherefore, the most logical answer is C.\n\nC"

It mentions potential dangers (storms, unknown wildlife), but it also describes it as having \"water, vegetable life\" and a \"fertile place\".\n*   **B. He wants to occupy and develop the area:** This aligns well with the text. Pop expresses a desire to \"carve a home out of the wilderness\" and envisions a future city (\"shoot from which... a great, brave city\"). This suggests a desire for development and permanent settlement.\n*   **C. Pop needs an area suitable just for building housing...**: While housing is important, Pop's concerns go beyond just building a house. He's looking for a location with specific attributes like fresh water, fertile land, and natural shelter.\n*   **D. He only needs a place that will support his family in the meantime:** Pop\u2019s language and vision suggest a longer-term goal, not just a temporary refuge. He is looking to create something lasting.\n\nTherefore, Pop's concern is primarily about establishing a settlement and developing the land.\n\nB"

This aligns with the passage's direct statement about the comparison to the S.S.P. man.\nB. The passage doesn't mention Pop carrying anything.\nC.
