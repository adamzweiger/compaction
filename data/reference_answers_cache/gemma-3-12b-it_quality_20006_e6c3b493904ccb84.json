      "generated_text": "Let's analyze the text to determine the author's perspective on blame.\n\n*   **Option A:** The text repeatedly criticizes individuals who remained in their positions despite knowing about Clinton's behavior. The author argues that their continued employment, even without direct involvement in the cover-up, constitutes a form of enabling. They question why people didn't quit \"on principle\" and highlight this lack of action as a failing. This aligns with the author's sentiment.\n*   **Option B:** The author explicitly rejects the idea that unwavering loyalty to Clinton is a universal good. They criticize Stephanopoulos for opportunistic betrayal and point out that loyalty without ethical considerations can be problematic.\n*   **Option C:** The text doesn't focus on alerting the media as a primary factor in assigning blame. It's a minor point.\n*   **Option D:** While the author touches upon the fact that some knew about Clinton\u2019s behavior, the core of their argument isn't that those individuals failed to inform Hillary specifically.\n\nTherefore, option A most accurately reflects the author's central argument.\n\nA"

We need to find the section where the author discusses the public's role. This is found near the end of the article, specifically concerning \"The American People\" scorecard.\n2. **Analyze the author's statement:** The author writes, \"Hypocritically claim to despise scandal, follow it breathlessly, then blame the media for obsessing over it. Are secretly fascinated by the sleaziness of it.\" This clearly assigns blame to the public for their contradictory behavior.\n3. **Match the statement to the options:** Option B directly reflects this sentiment - that the public pretends to dislike scandals but is actually fascinated by them.\n\nB"

Monica:** The text outlines numerous negative actions by Monica, including seduction, lying, and blabbing secrets. However, it also acknowledges she was \"sexually exploited.\" Her rating is -2.\n*   **D. Chelsea:** The text portrays her as the most innocent victim, forced to endure public humiliation and media scrutiny.

      "generated_text": "Let's analyze the text to see how Slate treats loyalty and disloyalty.\n\nThe article repeatedly points out that loyalty can be both a positive and a negative trait, depending on *when* and *how* it was demonstrated. For example, Stephanopoulos's loyalty is criticized as hypocritical because he helped cover up Clinton's behavior previously. Conversely, some individuals are praised for their loyalty, even while acknowledging they enabled bad behavior. Begala and Emanuel are considered relatively neutral due to their loyalty, despite also spinning Clinton\u2019s denials. Currie's lack of quitting is seen as a negative, while Vernon Jordan's actions are debated, with some seeing them as loyal and others as protecting Clinton inappropriately. Erskine Bowles is praised for staying silent, implying a form of disgusted loyalty.\n\nTherefore, the article doesn't view loyalty or disloyalty in a vacuum; it\u2019s assessed based on the specific circumstances and the actions taken.\n\nD"

Her rating is a +2, indicating some sympathy but not overwhelming.\n*   **Chelsea Clinton:** The article emphasizes she was \"humiliated and embarrassed,\" \"had family problems paraded before the world,\" and \"had her summer vacation ruined.\" Critically, it highlights that she \"had more of a choice to remove herself from the limelight because she was just the daughter.\" Her rating is a +10, indicating a very high degree of sympathy and largely portraying her as a victim.\n\nComparing the two, while both experienced harm, Chelsea is consistently presented as a more innocent victim with less agency and thus, more deserving of sympathy. Hillary's actions, or perceived actions, are viewed with more scrutiny.\n\nTherefore, option B best encapsulates the comparison: Both of them were viewed with some sympathy, but Chelsea was deemed more deserving of sympathy because Hillary was somewhat complicit.\n\nB"
